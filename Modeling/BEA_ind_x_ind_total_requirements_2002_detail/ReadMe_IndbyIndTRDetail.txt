Documentation for the 2002 Benchmark Input-Output Accounts: 
Detailed Requirements Tables after Redefinitions 

Source
 The data in these files were prepared by the Industry Benchmark 
 Division (IBD), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce.  
 For questions about the tables, please call the IBD main number 
 (202-606-5585), or FAX (202-606-5316), or send an E-Mail message to 
 benchmarkio@bea.gov.

Use of tables
  The tables are provided in a row, column, value format, rather than the 
  traditional matrix.  This format allows the file to display the transactions 
  in producers’ value, purchasers’ value, and all of the trade and 
  transportation margins.  The data are compatible with   current versions of 
  Microsoft Excel as well as with statistical software such as Quattro Pro and 
  SAS. These programs can support the file size as well as read and convert the 
  delimited files.  A spreadsheet, database, or statistical program can be 
  used to create custom cross-tabulated tables with the data set.  If you have 
  further questions regarding use of these files please contact the Industry 
  Benchmark Division at benchmarkio@bea.gov.
