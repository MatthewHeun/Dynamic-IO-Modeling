The global energy consumption is predicted to grow dramatically every year. Higher energy prices and public awareness for the global warming problem have opened up the market for solar cells. The generation of electricity with solar cells is considered to be one of the key technologies of the new century. The impressive growth is mainly based on solar cells made from polycrystalline silicon.

abstract = {
The life-cycle inventory analysis step of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) may currently suffer from several limitations, mainly concerned with the use of incomplete and unreliable data sources and methods of assessment. Many past LCA studies have used traditional inventory analysis methods, namely process analysis and input-output analysis. More recently, hybrid inventory analysis methods have been developed, combining these two traditional methods in an attempt to minimise their limitations. In light of recent improvements, these hybrid methods need to be compared and validated, as these too have been considered to have several limitations. This paper evaluates a recently developed hybrid inventory analysis method which aims to improve the limitations of previous methods. It was found that the truncation associated with process analysis can be up to 87\%, reflecting the considerable shortcomings in the quantity of process data currently available. Capital inputs were found to account for up to 22\% of the total inputs to a particular product. These findings suggest that current best-practice methods are sufficiently accurate for most typical applications, but this is heavily dependant upon data quality and availability. The use of input-output data assists in improving the system boundary completeness of life-cycle inventories. However, the use of input-output analysis alone does not always provide an accurate model for replacing process data. Further improvements in the quantity of process data currently available are needed to increase the reliability of life-cycle inventories.},

abstract = {Ethanol production from wheat has become an emerging economic activity in Henan Province due to the establishment in 2001 of the National Program for Alcohol Production. The program aimed at facing the unfolding world energy crisis in the near future and increasing China's energy security. Instead, in spite of claims for "green energy", such an activity is likely to generate great environmental damage and social problems. Moreover, the international market prices for raw materials (especially cereals) and fossil oil are putting this activity under siege. This research presents an energy and eMergy analysis of a typical wheat plantation/alcohol distillery system, in the Henan Province. Comparison is drawn with bioethanol production in Italy, based on corn from intensive, industrialized agriculture. Energy and eMergy indices of ethanol production from wheat and corn in the two agro-industrial systems are respectively as follows: output/input energy ratio, 1.09 (wheat) and 1.19 (corn): transformity of bioethanol, 2.77 x 105 and 1.89 x 105 seJ/J; renewability, 20\% and 11\%; eMergy yield ratio, 1.24 and 1.14: environmental loading ratio, 4.05 and 7.84; and finally eMergy sustainability index, 0.31 and 0.15. Results show that bioethanol from food crops is not a sustainable source of fuel. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper includes a comprehensive presentation of the consequential approach to system boundaries, allocation and data selection. It is based on a text produced within the SETAC-Europe working group on scenarios in LCA. For most of the methodological problems, we describe ideal methodological solutions as well as simplifications intended to make the method feasible in practice. Method We compile, summarize and refine descriptions of consequential methodology elements that have been presented in separate papers, in addition to methodological elements and general conclusions that have not previously been published. Results and Conclusions A consequential LCA ideally includes activities within and outside the life cycle that are affected by a change within the life cycle of the product under investigation. In many cases this implies the use of marginal data and that allocation is typically avoided through system expansion. The model resulting from a consequential life cycle inventory (LCI) also includes the alternative use of constrained production factors as well as the marginal supply and demand on affected markets. As a result, the consequential LCI model does not resemble the traditional LCI model, where the main material flows are described from raw material extraction to waste management. Instead, it is a model of causal relationships originating at the decision at hand or the decision-maker that the LCI is intended to inform.},

The paper analyzes the problems encountered in applying the concept of energy efficiency in the assesment of human activity. The existence of different hierarchical levels at which energetic efficiency can be assessed (i.e. individual level, societal level, ecological level) can make an objective definition of efficiency difficult if not imp[ossible.
An approach based on the thermodynamics of non-equilibrium is proposed to describe the dynamic interaction between human society and the ecosystem's natural processes. The society is considered a dissipative structure taking energy from the environment and investing energy into the environment in an iterative loop. Adopting this different perspective a more holistic view of the three levels is possible. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.},

Life cycle assessment, a method for the assessment of the environmental impacts of products, is briefly explained. A mathematical method to perform the calculations and to identify dominant aspects in the environmental load of a product is developed. The results are used to derive expressions for a marginal analysis which can be used for improvement analysis. In this way, a designer or process engineer can determine which processes or materials to consider first when (re)designing a product. The method developed can also be used to estimate the reliability of the determination of the environmental load of the products analyzed in terms of the reliability of the data of the processes involved.},

abstract = {One of the remaining important problems of life cycle inventory analysis is the allocation problem. A proper solution of this problem calls for a proper understanding of the nature of the problem itself. This paper argues that the established definition of the allocation problem as the fact that one unit process produces more than one function, is not appropriate. That definition points to an important reason of the occurrence of the problem, but the situation of internal (closed-loop) recycling already indicates that there may be product systems which contain multifunction processes, but which nevertheless need not exhibit an allocation problem. The paper proceeds by examining a number of simple hypothetical cases, and proposes a precise and operational definition of the allocation problem. This enables a systematic categorization of approaches for dealing with the allocation problem.},

abstract = {Twenty-seven economists and scientists from ten countries attended this Workshop, which considered the relationships between economic analysis and energy analysis. Energy analysis is a new Held whose objective is the evaluation of resource flows in societal processes using physical units. While we agreed that one of the principal roles of energy analysis is to furnish information that may be utilized in the allocation of the scarce resource energy, the Workshop unanimously concluded that this important function should not be interpreted as implying an energy theory of value. This conclusion rests on the simple observation, applicable across a wide range of institutional forms and degrees of technical development, that bes i des energy resources there are often indispensable primary inputs-labor, land, capital, non-energy minerals -- with equal claim to having their scarcities (relative to the needs for them) expressed in the valuation system that guides allocation. However, many participants believe that the results of energy analyses would have their greatest impact if they were presented in a form suitable for incorporation into a valuation system. Thus, the Workshop stressed the complementarity between economics and energy analysis. rather than elements of competition. The economist and the energy analyst alike believe that energy analysis can provide important physical data for the economic analysis of current productive and consumptive activity. Some Workshop members emphasized the use of energy analysis in assessment of activities in which there is clear evidence of market imperfections or failures. Additionally, energy analysis may be useful in technology assessment and in the evaluation of the impact of macroeconomic policies on energy demand. Technological assessments of this kind can also be used to define constraints within which a viable economic society must exist. It was clear that the interest of some energy analysts is not only in framing a response to scarcity of energy resources, but also in evaluating long-term destructive effects of intensive energy use.},

abstract = {Negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To be a viable alternative, a biofuel should provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. We use these criteria to evaluate, through life-cycle accounting, ethanol from corn grain and biodiesel from soybeans. Ethanol yields 25\% more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas biodiesel yields 93\% more. Compared with ethanol, biodiesel releases just 1.0\%, 8.3\%, and 13\% of the agricultural nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants, respectively, per net energy gain. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12\% by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41\% by biodiesel. Biodiesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. These advantages of biodiesel over ethanol come from lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion of feed-stocks to fuel. Neither biofuel can replace much petroleum without impacting food supplies. Even dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to biofuels would meet only 12\% of gasoline demand and 6\% of diesel demand. Until recent increases in petroleum prices, high production costs made biofuels unprofitable without subsidies. Biodiesel provides sufficient environmental advantages to merit subsidy. Transportation biofuels such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels.},

abstract = {In this letter I compare two measures of energy quality, energy return on energy invested (EROI) and energy intensity ratio (EIR) for the fossil fuel consumption and production of the United States. All other characteristics being equal, a fuel or energy system with a higher EROI or EIR is of better quality because more energy is provided to society. I define and calculate the EIR for oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity as measures of the energy intensity (units of energy divided by money) of the energy resource relative to the energy intensity of the overall economy. EIR measures based upon various unit prices for energy(e.g. /Btu of a barrel of oil) as well as total expenditures on energy supplies (e.g. total dollars spent on petroleum) indicate net energy at different points in the supply chain of the overall energy system. The results indicate that EIR is an easily calculated and effective proxy for EROI for US oil, gas, coal, and electricity. The EIR correlates well with previous EROI calculations, but adds additional information on energy resource quality within the supply chain. Furthermore, the EIR and EROI of oil and gas as well as coal were all in decline for two time periods within the last 40 years, and both time periods preceded economic recessions.},

abstract = {Concerns surrounding the continued, un-checked use of petroleum-based fuels in the transportation sector, the search for more sustainable, renewable alternatives, and the constraints of the existing supply infrastructure in the United States have placed a spotlight on biomass-derived fuels. The central question of the ethanol debate has changed from "Should we make ethanol?" to "From what should we make ethanol?" emphasizing the importance of understanding the differences between specific biomass supply systems for fuel ethanol. When presented with numerous options, the priorities of an individual decision maker will define which feedstock alternative is the most appropriate choice for development from their perspective. This paper demonstrates how energy data can be successfully used to quantify assessment metrics beyond a standard net energy value calculation, thus quantifying the relative "value" of ethanol supply systems. This value is defined based on decision-maker priorities that were adopted from national energy policy priorities: increased national energy security and increased conservation of energy resources. Nine energy assessment metrics that quantify detailed system energy data are calculated and a straightforward comparative assessment is performed between corn and corn stover feedstocks produced under the same farm scenario. Corn stover is shown to be more compatible with the national energy policy priorities and it is recommended that additional research be performed on utilizing this feedstock from the corn farm.

In the energy filled there are many choices, conflicts, constraints and opportunities. While the author admits that net energy analysis has never claimed relevance to most of these issues, he asserts that the component to which it does address itself -- the indirect inputs of energy to supply technologies -- is relatively insignificant. It is within the noise level of near, let alone long term, judgements and uncertainty. Though analyses might have some value in checking the [`]net returns' of very rapid and large technological shifts, eg insulation or nuclear programmes, to date they have not identified any significant effects when the whole energy system is taken into account. Finally, he concludes that the methods of net energy analysis contain several flaws which are not easily mended and which put at low confidence level on results.

abstract = {The environmental costs and benefits of producing bioenergy crops can be measured both in terms of the relative effects on soil, water and wildlife habitat quality of replacing alternate cropping systems with the designated bioenergy system, and in terms of the quality and amount of energy that is produced per unit of energy expended. While many forms of herbaceous and woody energy crops will likely contribute to future biofuels systems, The Department of Energy's Bioenegy Feedstock Development Program (BFDP), has chosen to focus its primary herbaceous crops research emphasis on a perennial grass species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The choice of switchgrass as a model bioenergy species was based on its high yields, high nutrient use efficiency and wide geographic distribution. Another important consideration was its positive environmental attributes. The latter include its positive effects on soil quality and stability, its cover value for wildlife, and relatively low inputs of energy, water and agrochemicals required per unit of energy produced. A comparison of the energy budgets for corn, which is the primary current source of bioethanol, and switchgrass reveals that the efficiency of energy production for a perennial grass system can exceed that for an energy intensive annual row crop by as much as 15 times. In addition potential reductions in CO2 emissions, tied to the energetic efficiency of producing transportation fuels and replacing non-renewable petrochemical fuels with ethanol derived from grasses are very promising. Calculated carbon sequestration rates may exceed those of annual crops by as much as 20-30 times, due in part to carbon storage in the soil. These differences have major implications for both the rate and efficiency with which fossil energy sources can be replaced with cleaner burning biofuels. Current research is emphasizing quantification of changes in soil nutrients and soil organic matter to provide improved understanding of the long term changes in soil quality associated with annual removal of high yields of herbaceous energy crops.},

The paper begins by stating the value of energy accounting and defining the subject. The aims of energy accounting are then listed and discussed.
The three basic methods of energy accounting are currently input/output table analysis, statistical analysis and process analysis. In turn, these are briefly described and then illustrated by some recent examples of their application.
The use of input/output table analysis to explore the effect of rising energy costs on industrial prices is described; this was an important input to the 1974 National Economic Development Office report on energy. This is followed by a discussion of how and when a knowledge of the energy intensity of capital goods can be used to assess energy pay-back times and energy gain ratios in considering possible new sources of energy.
The statistical method is illustrated first by referring to the estimation of energy overheads for the various fuel industries and, secondly, by showing the very detailed energy inputs which have to be accounted in determining the average energy requirement of a typical industrial commodity, viz. iron castings.
Finally, the method of process energy analysis, as advocated by the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study (IFIAS), is briefly described and its application to a study of the iron casting industry by ETSU referred to.},

abstract = {During the last 5 years the PV industry continues to experience a strong economic growth between 15\% and 30\% per year. Multi-crystalline silicon became the preferred material for PV production with a share of more than 50\% of the shipped PV modules world-wide. For the first time, the available quantity of the classical silicon feedstock sources for the PV industry—electronic grade silicon rejects from the silicon and microelectronics industry—is close to be not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the PV industry. From this situation arises the need to develop short- and long-term solutions to guarantee a sustainable supply of the PV industry with suitable silicon feedstock at acceptable costs.

This paper presents a possible route for short- and long-term solutions to provide solar grade (SoG) silicon feedstock for the PV industry. On a short-term basis a twofold solution is proposed: (i) reduction of silicon consumption by reducing the wafer thickness and the introduction of recycling scenarios for silicon waste produced by the PV industry, (ii) introduction of very low-resistivity silicon (0.1\&\#xa0;$\Omega$\&\#xa0;cm).

On long term, a route towards the establishment of a SoG silicon production based on widely available metallurgical grade silicon is proposed. This route includes the development of suitable purification techniques. First results that allowed to lower the impurity tolerances for SoG silicon are presented. The introduction of silicon feedstock with higher impurity concentrations which show a tendency to interact with crystal defects and lead to a degradation of the material performance also requires passivation concepts to achieve highly performing solar cells.},

In the December 1975 issue of Energy Policy, Gerald Leach expressed strong doubts over the usefulness of net energy analysis. He asserted that the indirect inputs of energy to the supply industries were relatively insignificant, and well within the noise level of the data. Furthermore net energy analysis contained several methodological flaws, which meants that its results were open to a variety of interpretations and unlikely to be of much use in decision making. Here, Malcolm Slesser, Director of the Energy Studies Unit at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, takes issue with Leach.},

abstract = {Life Cycle Inventory analysis (LCI) is defined as a phase of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) involving the compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs for a given product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040 1998a). The concept of LCI has been adopted for cleaner production as early as the 1960s, and has had broad industrial and academic application in the last decades (Vigon et al. 1993). Com pared to the other phases of LCA, LCI has been considered a rather straightforward procedure except for several issues such as allocation (see e.g. Fava et al. 1991). Reflecting this belief, the method used for LCI compilation has rarely been questioned, although a large number of software, LCI databases and case studies have been released so far. However, contrary to the common belief, different methods have been available for LCI, and they often generate significantly different results. Therefore, it is necessary to assess advantages and limitations of different LCI methods and properly select suitable one(s) for each specific application. It is the aim of this paper to review and compare available methods for LCI compilation, and guide LCA users to properly select the most relevant methods for their analyses in relation to the goal and scope of the study as well as the resources and time available. With adaptations, the results are applicable outside the realm of LCA as well. This paper is organized as follows: first available methods of LCI compilation are presented. Two computational approaches, process flow diagram and matrix inversion, are assessed, and then methods that utilize economic Input-Output Analysis (IOA) are described with special attention to hybrid analyses. Secondly, these methods are summarized and compared in terms of data requirements, uncertainty of source data, upstream system boundary, technological system boundary, geographical system boundary, available analytical tools, time and labor intensity, simplicity of application, required computational tools and available software tools. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and compliance of these methods to ISO standards and future outlooks are discussed.},

abstract = {Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a method for evaluating the environmental impacts of products holistically, including direct and supply chain impacts. The current LCA methodologies and the standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) impose practical difficulties for drawing system boundaries; decisions on inclusion or exclusion of processes in an analysis (the cutoff criteria) are typically not made on a scientific basis. In particular, the requirement of deciding which processes could be excluded from the inventory can be rather difficult to meet because many excluded processes have often never been assessed by the practitioner, and therefore, their negligibility cannot be guaranteed. LCA studies utilizing economic input−output analysis have shown that, in practice, excluded processes can contribute as much to the product system under study as included processes; thus, the subjective determination of the system boundary may lead to invalid results. System boundaries in LCA are discussed herein with particular attention to outlining hybrid approaches as methods for resolving the boundary selection problem in LCA. An input−output model can be used to describe at least a part of a product system, and an ISO-compatible system boundary selection procedure can be designed by applying hybrid input−output-assisted approaches. There are several hybrid input−output analysis-based LCA methods that can be implemented in practice for broadening system boundary and also for ISO compliance.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In the USA, biomass crop systems will be needed to meet future ethanol production goals. We estimated production costs, profits, and energy budgets for three potential crop systems for the Upper Midwest: continuous corn with stover harvest, an alfalfa–corn rotation with stover harvest, and switchgrass. Production costs, profits, and on-farm energy use were greatest for continuous corn, less for alfalfa–corn, and least for switchgrass. Energy to transport crops was similar for all crop systems. Both energy used to produce ethanol and energy output in ethanol was greatest for continuous corn, less for alfalfa–corn, and least for switchgrass. Co-product energy output was 32\% greater for alfalfa–corn than continuous corn and 42\% greater than switchgrass. Net energy produced (outputs–inputs) was greatest for switchgrass, followed by continuous corn, and then alfalfa–corn. Efficiency of energy production (outputs/inputs) was greatest for switchgrass, followed by alfalfa–corn, and then continuous corn. Our analysis emphasizes tradeoffs among crop systems. Corn may produce high rates of ethanol and net energy, but will do so least efficiently and with the greatest erosion and N leaching. Corn may have the greatest production costs, but return the greatest profit. Comparatively, alfalfa–corn will produce less ethanol and net energy, but will do so more efficiently, and with less erosion and little N leaching. Production costs, but also profits, may be less for alfalfa–corn than continuous corn. Switchgrass may produce the most net energy and will do so most efficiently and with the least erosion, but will also yield the least ethanol. Nitrogen leaching will be less for switchgrass than corn, but greater than alfalfa–corn. Switchgrass may be the least expensive to produce, but may return a profit only if selling prices or yields are high.},

Among the different platforms, there are two obvious advantages to using lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production: higher net energy gain and lower production costs. However, the use of lignocellulosic ethanol as a viable alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels largely depends on plant biotechnology breakthroughs. We examine how biotechnology, such as lignin modification, abiotic stress resistance, nutrition usage, in planta expression of cell wall digestion enzymes, biomass production, feedstock establishment, biocontainment of transgenes, metabolic engineering, and basic research, can be used to address the challenges faced by bioenergy crop production.},

abstract = {Renewable distributed electricity generation can play a significant role in meeting today's energy policy goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy security, while adding supply to meet increasing energy demand. However, the exact potential benefits are still a matter of debate. The objective of this study is to evaluate the life cycle implications (environmental, economic and energy) of distributed generation (DG) technologies. A complementary objective is to compare the life cycle implications of DG technologies with the centralized electricity production representing the Northeastern American context. Environmental and energy implications are modeled according to the recommendations in the ISO 14040 standard and this, using different indicators: Human Health; Ecosystem Quality; Climate Change; Resources and Non-Renewable Energy Payback Ratio. Distinctly, economic implications are modeled using conventional life cycle costing. DG technologies include two types of grid-connected photovoltaic panels (3 kWp mono-crystalline and poly-crystalline) and three types of micro-wind turbines (1, 10 and 30 kW) modeled for average, below average and above average climatic conditions in the province of Quebec (Canada). A sensitivity analysis was also performed using different scenarios of centralized energy systems based on average and marginal (short- and long-term) technology approaches. Results show the following. First, climatic conditions (i.e., geographic location) have a significant effect on the results for the environmental, economic and energy indicators. More specifically, it was shown that the 30 kW micro-wind turbine is the best technology for above average conditions, while 3 kWp poly-crystalline photovoltaic panels are preferable for below average conditions. Second, the assessed DG technologies do not show benefits in comparison to the centralized Quebec grid mix (average technology approach). On the other hand, the 30 kW micro-wind turbine shows a potential benefit as long as the Northeastern American electricity market is considered (i.e., oil and coal centralized technologies are affected for the short- and long-term marginal scenarios, respectively). Photovoltaic panels could also become more competitive if the acquisition cost decreased. In conclusion, DG utilization will represent an improvement over centralized electricity production in a Northeastern American context, with respect to the environmental, energy and economic indicators assessed, and under the appropriate conditions discussed (i.e., geographical locations and affected centralized electricity production scenarios).},

abstract = {Global climate change concerns have lead to growing demand for renewable energy sources (RES). However the viability of these sources is critically dependent on environmental, economic and technological considerations. This paper focuses on the environmental aspect of future photovoltaic (PV) systems which are assessed through life cycle analysis (LCA). Previous LCA studies on commercially available PV systems are reviewed. The sustainable evaluation methods used in these studies are also discussed. These methods are applied to the hybrid quantum dot (QD)-based solar cells currently under development within a project between the University of Manchester and Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to develop affordable solar cells with efficiencies up to 10\% for micro-generation applications. Presently hybrid QD-based solar cells are not commercially fabricated: therefore the study is mostly based on very small laboratory-scale production. For easy comparability 10\% conversion efficiency and 25 years lifetime are initially assumed. Lower conversion efficiencies and shorter lifetimes likely to initially characterise emerging PV technologies such as the hybrid QD-based solar cells are discussed. Comparable criteria for sustainability, of electricity-generating systems namely net energy ratio (NER), energy pay-back time (EPB-T) and CO2 emissions per unit generated during lifetime are found to be lower than current commercially available PV modules.

abstract = {Since solar energy systems feed on a ‘clean’ energy source, they do not produce polluting emissions during their operation. However, they carry the environmental weight of other phases in their life cycle. In order to analyze the energy and environmental profile of these systems, it is necessary to expand the system boundaries, taking into account also the ‘hidden impacts’ related to production, transportation and system disposal at the end of its technical life. Here, the life cycle assessment methodology is applied to derive a complete and extended energy and environmental profile of photovoltaic systems. As reference case, a conventional multi-crystalline building integrated system is selected, retrofitted on a tilted roof, located in Rome (Italy) and connected to the national electricity grid. Then improved configurations of the reference system are assessed, focusing on building integration issues and the operational phase (considering an experimental hybrid photovoltaic system with heat recovery). Environmental ‘pay back times’ of the assessed systems are then calculated for CO2 equivalent emissions and embodied energy. All the analyzed configurations are characterized by environmental pay back times one order of magnitude lower than their expected life time (3–4 years vs. 15–30 years). Thanks to a wider exploitation of photovoltaic potential during its ‘zero emission operation’, these results are further lowered by photovoltaic hybrid systems (environmental pay back times, depending on heat recovery configuration, go down to 40–50\% of the values calculated for the reference case).},

abstract = {The procedure described allows comparison of various energy transformation processes, including those using fossil fuels, solar energy, and conservation. The procedure allows a determination of the relative feasibility and desirability of each process for producing a surplus of energy beyond the output that could be obtained directly from the process energy (i.e., the energy needed for self-reproduction). The analysis includes all energy directly or indirectly committed to the process, throughout the entire economy.

To quantify the feasibility of energy transformation, an input-output ratio was calculated for 44 processes. The calculations exclude fuels transformed directly into energy output. Adjustments were made for differences in quality, end use, and time of use. A low ratio means that the process should receive further research and development funding or else should be dropped from consideration. The input-output ratio of a feasible transformation process may decline with time because of a resource scarcity, indicating a falling desirability. Highly desirable processes, ones with ratios that show the least signs of declining, should also be compared for future use on the basis of their relative effects on labor needs, capital requirements, the demand for critical material, and their environmental impact. Policy conclusions are hampered by an unevenness in the quality of the available data. Nevertheless, a useful and comprehensive method of energy analysis is demonstrated.},

abstract = { Climate change and water scarcity are important issues for today’s power sector. To inform capacity expansion decisions, hybrid life cycle assessment is used to evaluate a reference design of a parabolic trough concentrating solar power (CSP) facility located in Daggett, CA, along four sustainability metrics: life cycle (LC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, cumulative energy demand (CED), and energy payback time (EPBT). This wet-cooled, 103 MW plant utilizes mined nitrates salts in its two-tank, thermal energy storage (TES) system. Design alternatives of dry-cooling, a thermocline TES, and synthetically derived nitrate salt are evaluated. During its LC, the reference CSP plant is estimated to emit 26 g of CO2eq per kWh, consume 4.7 L/kWh of water, and demand 0.40 MJeq/kWh of energy, resulting in an EPBT of approximately 1 year. The dry-cooled alternative is estimated to reduce LC water consumption by 77\% but increase LC GHG emissions and CED by 8\%. Synthetic nitrate salts may increase LC GHG emissions by 52\% compared to mined. Switching from two-tank to thermocline TES configuration reduces LC GHG emissions, most significantly for plants using synthetically derived nitrate salts. CSP can significantly reduce GHG emissions compared to fossil-fueled generation; however, dry-cooling may be required in many locations to minimize water consumption. },

Significant progress has been made over the last two decades in improving the performance of amorphous silicon (a-Si) based solar cells and in ramping up the commercial production of a-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules, which is currently more than 40 peak megawatts (MWp) per year. The progress in a-Si solar cell technology can be attributed to concurrent advances in the areas of new and improved materials, novel cell designs and in the development of large-area deposition techniques suitable for mass production. There are currently more than 40 research, development and engineering organisations at universities, companies and government laboratories around the world that are actively investigating a-Si PV technology.},

abstract = {One technique for evaluating the costs of energy systems is net energy analysis, which compares the quantity of energy delivered to society by an energy system to the energy used directly and indirectly in the delivery process. a quantity called the energy return on investment (EROI). Such an investigation involves aggregating different energy flows. A variety of methods have been proposed, but none has received universal acceptance. This paper shows that the method of aggregation has crucial effects on the results of the analysis. It is argued that economic approaches such as the index or marginal product method are superior because they account for differences in quality among fuels. The thermal equivalent and quality-corrected EROI for petroleum extraction in the US show the same general pattern: a rise to a maximum in the early 1970s, a sharp decline throughout the 1970s. a recovery in the 1980s, and then another modest decline in the 1990s. However, the quality-corrected EROI is consistently much lower than the thermal equivalent EROI, and it declines faster and to a greater extent than the thermal equivalent EROI. The results indicate that quality corrections have important effects on the results of energy analyses. The overall decline in the EROI for petroleum extraction in the US suggests that depletion has raised the energy costs of extraction. This is generally consistent with the overall pattern of oil extraction. i.e. both extraction and the EROI for extraction show a decline since the early 1970s. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a test drilling program to evaluate the physical parameters of the resource base. Data from this evaluation program and other studies were incorporated into a model that compared the energy costs and yields of extracting geopressured gas. Results indicate that even the most promising geopressured prospects yield little net energy, even under optimistic assumptions concerning labor, government, and environmental energy costs. Conventional natural gas wells still yield substantially greater net fuel. Alternative technologies such as coal gasification also yield greater net fuel. We conclude that geopressured gas resources in the Gulf Coast do not represent a significant source of net energy for the nation based on current knowledge of reservoir parameters and extraction technology.},

abstract = {A series of hypotheses is presented about the relation of national energy use to national economic activity (both time series and cross-sectional) which offer a different perspective from standard economics for the assessment of historical and current economic events. The analysis incorporates nearly 100 years of time series data and 3 years of cross-sectional data on 87 sectors of the United States economy. Gross national product, labor productivity, and price levels are all correlated closely with various aspects of energy use, and these correlations are improved when corrections are made for energy quality. A large portion of the apparent increase in U.S. energy efficiency has been due to our ability to expand the relative use of highquality fuels such as petroleum and electricity, and also to relative shifts in fuel use between sectors of the economy. The concept of energy return on investment is introduced as a major driving force in our economy, and data are provided which show a marked decline in energy return on investment for all our principal fuels in recent decades. Future economic growth will depend largely on the net energy yield of alternative fuel sources, and some standard economic models may need to be modified to account for the biophysical constraints on human economic activity.},

abstract = {Primary energy sources exhibited regular long-term logistic substitution trends from the mid-19th century through the third quarter of the 20th century. This analysis, based on an extension of the Fisher-Pry substitution model, accounted for the observed historical shifts of primary energy use from sources of wood, coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear. In the mid-1980s the substitution dynamics was replaced by a relatively constant contribution from oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, and hydropower. However, a major factor in energy use dynamics in this recent period was substitution of conservation and efficiency for actual fuel use. The energy efficiency is measured as the ratio of economic activity to the rate of energy use (energy intensity). To incorporate these data into the logistic analysis, a method for estimating the fraction of energy saved by the increased efficiency was used. With this interpretation, energy efficiency fits within the substitution model. Furthermore, to identify indications of future energy scenarios, as well as to test the logistic substitution analysis, another statistical approach using ternary diagrams was developed. The consistent results from both logistic substitution and statistical analysis are compared with recent energy projections, trends in decarbonization, Kondratieff waves, and other efficiency measures. While the specific future mix of renewables and nuclear energy sources is uncertain, the more general logistic dynamics pattern of the energy system seems to be continuing as it has for about 150 years now.},

abstract = {The extent and timing of cost-reducing improvements in low-carbon energy systems are important sources of uncertainty in future levels of greenhouse-gas emissions. Models that assess the costs of climate change mitigation policy, and energy policy in general, rely heavily on learning curves to include technology dynamics. Historically, no energy technology has changed more dramatically than photovoltaics (PV), the cost of which has declined by a factor of nearly 100 since the 1950s. Which changes were most important in accounting for the cost reductions that have occurred over the past three decades? Are these results consistent with the notion that learning from experience drove technical change? In this paper, empirical data are assembled to populate a simple model identifying the most important factors affecting the cost of PV. The results indicate that learning from experience, the theoretical mechanism used to explain learning curves, only weakly explains change in the most important factors—plant size, module efficiency, and the cost of silicon. Ways in which the consideration of a broader set of influences, such as technical barriers, industry structure, and characteristics of demand, might be used to inform energy technology policy are discussed.},

However, many important environmental effects of biofuel production are poorly understood. New metrics that measure specific resource inputs are developed, but further research into environmental metrics is needed.

The majority of silicon wafers used for solar cells are Czochralski (CZ) single crystalline and directional solidification, or cast, multicrystalline (mc) material. The split between the two types of wafer is presently about 55\% mc-Si and 45\% CZ-Si. Until 1995 CZ wafers represented 60\% of the substrates used by industry and mc-Si wafers around 25\%. The fast scale up of commercially available multicrystalline wafers changed the picture rapidly. The remainder of the silicon substrates used by the industry are non-wafered sheets or ribbons that are of different types and have recently gained significant production figures, following long development phases. Non-wafer silicon accounted for about 4\% of the market in 2001, up from 1-2\% in the mid-1990s [1, 2].},

We provide a preliminary assessment of EROI for the world\^{a}€™s most important fuels, oil and gas, based on time series of global production and estimates of energy inputs derived from monetary expenditures for all publicly traded oil and gas companies and estimates of energy intensities of those expenditures. We estimate that EROI at the wellhead was roughly 26:1 in 1992, increased to 35:1 in 1999, and then decreased to 18:1 in 2006. These trends imply that global supplies of petroleum available to do economic work are considerably less than estimates of gross reserves and that EROI is declining over time and with increased annual drilling levels. Our global estimates of EROI have a pattern similar to, but somewhat higher than, the United States, which has better data on energy costs but a more depleted resource base.},

abstract = {Abstract
Since the early days of terrestrial photovoltaics, a common perception has been that ‘first generation’ silicon wafer-based solar cells eventually would be replaced by a ‘second generation’ of lower cost thin-film technology, probably also involving a different semiconductor. Historically, cadmium sulphide, amorphous silicon, copper indium diselenide, cadmium telluride and now thin-film polycrystalline silicon have been regarded as key thin-film candidates. Any mature solar cell technology seems likely to evolve to the stage where costs are dominated by those of the constituent materials, be they silicon wafers or glass sheet. It is argued, therefore, that photovoltaics is likely to evolve, in its most mature form, to a ‘third generation’ of high-efficiency thin-film technology. By high efficiency, what is meant is energy conversion values double or triple the 15–20\% range presently targeted, closer to the thermodynamic limit of 93\%. Tandem cells are the best known of such high-efficiency approaches, where efficiency can be increased merely by adding more cells of different bandgap to a cell stack, at the expense of increased complexity and spectral sensitivity. However, a range of other more ‘paralleled’ approaches offer similar efficiency to an infinite stack of tandem cells. These options are reviewed together with possible approaches for practical implementation, likely to become more feasible with the evolution of materials technology over the next two decades.

An energy breeder can be defined as a device which creates capacity to generate useful energy without consuming energy stocks. Any solar conversion device (SCD) that delivers in its life-time more energy than needed to maintain and rebuild itself is a solar energy breeder, since some of the surplus energy can be used to build more such SCDs. A breeding SCD must necessarily produce energy of sufficiently high intrinsic quality (e.g. electricity) or high temperature to provide energy at the various temperatures needed for its fabrication and maintenance. Thus, the amount of energy produced by an SCD breeder at various temperatures must be examined, in addition to the simple energy quantity produced over a solar collector lifetime. Capacity breeding rates are calculated for both SCDs producing electricity intrinsically (e.g. photovoltaics) and for SCDs producing both electricity and a significant amount of thermal energy (e.g. total solar energy systems).},

Within this research project, three grid-connected photovoltaic systems (sc-Si, pc-Si and a-Si based) are examined in regard to CED and cumulative emissions. The production of these systems was chosen to take place in seven European countries: Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.

Due to the fact that electricity demand does play a major role in production of photovoltaics and that power generation differs throughout these countries CED varies from about 23,200 to 65,200 MJ/kWp. The cumulative emissions (CEm) were found to lie between about 900 and 4000 kg CO2/kWp, 1.9 and 5.5 kg NOx/kWp and 2.4 and 4.8 kg SO2/kWp.},

abstract = {Economic production and, more generally, most global societies, are overwhelmingly dependant upon depleting supplies of fossil fuels. There is considerable concern amongst resource scientists, if not most economists, as to whether market signals or cost benefit analysis based on today\^{a}€™s prices are sufficient to guide our decisions about our energy future. These suspicions and concerns were escalated during the oil price increase from 2005 \^{a}€“ 2008 and the subsequent but probably related market collapse of 2008. We believe that Energy Return On Investment (EROI) analysis provides a useful approach for examining disadvantages and advantages of different fuels and also offers the possibility to look into the future in ways that markets seem unable to do. The goal of this paper is to review the application of EROI theory to both natural and economic realms, and to assess preliminarily the minimum EROI that a society must attain from its energy exploitation to support continued economic activity and social function. In doing so we calculate herein a basic first attempt at the minimum EROI for current society and some of the consequences when that minimum is approached. The theory of the minimum EROI discussed here, which describes the somewhat obvious but nonetheless important idea that for any being or system to survive or grow it must gain substantially more energy than it uses in obtaining that energy, may be especially important. Thus any particular being or system must abide by a \^{a}€\oe Law of Minimum EROI\^{a}€ , which we calculate for both oil and corn-based ethanol as about 3:1 at the mine-mouth/farm-gate. Since most biofuels have EROI\^{a}€™s of less than 3:1 they must be subsidized by fossil fuels to be useful.},

The update of LCA results in this paper demonstrates that considerable improvements were reached in the environmental profile of CdTe PV power and EPBT over the last four years. Depending on the location of installation in Europe, the corresponding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of PV power for ground mounted power plants are between 19 and 30 g CO2-equiv./kWh and between 0.7 and 1.1 years in terms of EBPT. Furthermore, for the first time, the environmental impacts due to an already applied recycling procedure of CdTe modules and its relative contribution to the CdTe PV life cycle has been investigated.

abstract = {Given declining reliance on fossil fuels because of both their greenhouse gas emissions and depletion of reserves, renewable energy (RE) will need to become the main energy form. Most of the technical potential for RE is in intermittently available sources, mainly wind and solar. As penetration from these sources rises, conversion to another energy form, and energy storage, will be needed. Here we assume the energy carrier is hydrogen. This paper examines the consequences for net energy output over time for various rates of growth of wind-hydrogen systems. Wind energy is chosen for this case study because its output is presently far greater than solar, and because its costs are lower. We find that high growth rates of turbine-hydrogen installations lead to [`]boom and bust' cycles in both equipment manufacture, and in net energy output. The main reason for these cycles is that such systems have high up-front input energy costs. To avoid these large swings, the rate of installation will have to be cut back, which limits the rate at which energy alternatives can supplant fossil fuels.},

The increasing demand for renewable forms of energy is making photovoltaic products an important part of the energy supply future. The costs of producing photovoltaic modules have been significantly reduced during the last 10 years as manufacturing costs per watt have dropped from over 6 per peak watt to less than half of that value now. This paper summarizes progress in several aspects of photovoltaic manufacturing which have contributed to this reduction. Crystal growth improvements, both in yield and machine design, have reduced the energy consumption by a factor of 3 and improved silicon utilization by 40\%. Wafer slicing process changes have resulted in 66\% more wafers being produced for a given amount of silicon. Cell production improvements in both automation and improved efficiency have reduced the labor cost contribution by 40\% per watt. Larger modules and better materials have added another 10\% reduction in the cost to produce photovoltaics. These improvements have contributed to a better energy payback time, reducing it from over 5 years to approximately 3. Reductions in cost and improvements in energy efficiency have made photovoltaic products a commercially viable alternate energy source. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to forecast the technological development and cost of wind turbines and the production costs of wind electricity, frequent use is made of the so-called experience curve concept. Experience curves of wind turbines are generally based on data describing the development of national markets, which cause a number of problems when applied for global assessments. To analyze global wind energy price development more adequately, we compose a global experience curve. First, underlying factors for past and potential future price reductions of wind turbines are analyzed. Also possible implications and pitfalls when applying the experience curve methodology are assessed. Second, we present and discuss a new approach of establishing a global experience curve and thus a global progress ratio for the investment cost of wind farms. Results show that global progress ratios for wind farms may lie between 77\% and 85\% (with an average of 81\%), which is significantly more optimistic than progress ratios applied in most current scenario studies and integrated assessment models. While the findings are based on a limited amount of data, they may indicate faster price reduction opportunities than so far assumed. With this global experience curve we aim to improve the reliability of describing the speed with which global costs of wind power may decline.},

abstract = {Stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems comprise one of the most promising electrification solutions for covering the demand of remote consumers. However, such systems are strongly questioned due to extreme life-cycle (LC) energy requirements. For similar installations to be considered as environmentally sustainable, their LC energy content must be compensated by the respective useful energy production, i.e. their energy pay-back period (EPBP) should be found less than their service period. In this context, an optimum sizing methodology is currently developed, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy. Various energy autonomous stand-alone PV-lead-acid battery systems are examined and two different cases are investigated; a high solar potential area and a medium solar potential area. By considering that the PV-battery (PV-Bat) system's useful energy production is equal to the remote consumer's electricity consumption, optimum cadmium telluride (CdTe) based systems yield the minimum EPBP (15 years). If achieving to exploit the net PV energy production however, the EPBP is found less than 20 years for all PV types. Finally, the most interesting finding concerns the fact that in all cases examined the contribution of the battery component exceeds 27\% of the system LC energy requirements, reflecting the difference between grid-connected and stand-alone configurations.

abstract = {The exploitation of solar energy by autonomous, photovoltaic (PV) based systems offers the opportunity for satisfying the electrification needs of numerous remote consumers worldwide in an environmentally friendly way. On the other hand, the sustainable character of these systems is strongly questioned by the energy intensity of processes involved in the various life cycle (LC) stages of the system components. Although there are several studies concerned with the estimation of the energy pay-back period (EPBP) for grid-connected systems, the same is not valid for stand-alone configurations. In this context, an integrated methodology is currently developed in order to estimate the EPBP of PV-battery (PV-Bat) configurations ensuring 100\% energy autonomy. The main scope of the proposed analysis is to determine the optimum size of a corresponding system, comprised of multi-crystalline (me-Si) PV modules and lead-acid (PbA) batteries, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy, i.e. minimum EPBP. For this purpose, a representative case study examined considers the electrification needs of a typical remote consumer on the Island of Rhodes, Greece. According to the results obtained, the autonomous energy character of the system is reflected by the comparatively higher EPBP in comparison with the corresponding grid-connected option, nevertheless the PV-Bat configurations analyzed clearly constitute sustainable energy solutions. Finally, in order to increase the reliability of the calculation results, a sensitivity analysis is carried out, based on the variation of the input energy content data.

abstract = {In life cycle assessment (LCA) of solar PV systems, energy pay back time (EPBT) is the commonly used indicator to justify its primary energy use. However, EPBT is a function of competing energy sources with which electricity from solar PV is compared, and amount of electricity generated from the solar PV system which varies with local irradiation and ambient conditions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use site-specific EPBT for major decision-making in power generation planning. LCA and life cycle cost analysis are performed for a distributed 2.7 kW(p) grid-connected monocrystalline solar PV system operating in Singapore. This paper presents various EPBT analyses of the solar PV system with reference to a fuel oil-fired steam turbine and their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs are also compared. The study reveals that GHG emission from electricity generation from the solar PV system is less than one-fourth that from an oil-fired steam turbine plant and one-half that from a gas-fired combined cycle plant. However, the cost of electricity is about five to seven times higher than that from the oil or gas fired power plant. The environmental uncertainties of the solar PV system are also critically reviewed and presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All other characteristics being equal, a fuel or energy system with a higher EROI or EIR is of better quality because more energy is provided to society. I define and calculate the EIR for oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity as measures of the energy intensity (units of energy divided by money) of the energy resource relative to the energy intensity of the overall economy. EIR measures based upon various unit prices for energy(e.g. /Btu of a barrel of oil) as well as total expenditures on energy supplies (e.g. total dollars spent on petroleum) indicate net energy at different points in the supply chain of the overall energy system. The results indicate that EIR is an easily calculated and effective proxy for EROI for US oil, gas, coal, and electricity. The EIR correlates well with previous EROI calculations, but adds additional information on energy resource quality within the supply chain. Furthermore, the EIR and EROI of oil and gas as well as coal were all in decline for two time periods within the last 40 years, and both time periods preceded economic recessions.},

abstract = {-  Part 1: Present Situation and Future Perspectives  Part 2: Application on an Island Economy    Goal, Scope and Background   Incorporation of exposure and risk concepts into life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is often impaired by the number of sources and the complexity of site-specific impact assessment, especially when input-output (I-O) analysis is used to evaluate upstream processes. This makes it difficult to interpret LCIA outputs, especially in policy contexts. In this study, we develop an LCIA tool which takes into account the geographical variability in both emissions and exposure, and which can be applied to all economic sectors in I-O analysis. Our method relies on screening-level risk calculations and methods to estimate population exposure per unit of emissions from specific geographic locations.     Methods   We propose a simplified impact assessment approach using the concept of intake fraction, which is the fraction of a pollutant or its precursor emitted that is eventually inhaled or ingested by the population. Instead of running a complex site-specific exposure analysis, intake fractions allow for the accounting of the regional variability in exposure due to meteorological factors and population density without much computational burden. We calculate sector-specific intake fractions using previously-derived regression models and apply these values to the supply chain emissions to screen for the sectors whose emissions largely contribute to the total exposures. Thus, the analytical steps are simplified by relying on these screening-level risk calculations. We estimate population exposure per unit emissions from specific geographic locations only for the facilities and pollutants that pass an initial screening analysis. We test our analytical approach with reference to the case of increasing insulation for new single-family homes in the US. We quantify the public health costs from increasing insulation manufacturing and compare them with the benefits from energy savings, focusing on mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to primary and secondary fine particles (PM2.5) as well as cancer risk associated with exposure to toxic air pollutants. We estimate health impacts using concentration-response functions from the published literature and compare the costs and benefits of the program by assigning monetary values to the health risks. In the second part of this paper, we present the results of our case study and consider the implications for incorporating exposure and risk concepts into I-O LCA.     Conclusions   We have presented a methodology to incorporate regional variability in emissions and exposure into input-output LCA, using reduced-form information about the relationship between emissions and population exposure, along with standard input-output analysis and risk assessment methods. The location-weighted intake fractions can overcome the difficulty in incorporation of regional exposure in LCIA.},

Calculations of the possible effect on CO2 reduction by PV energy systems may be incorrect if system borders are not set wide enough and remain on a national level, as can be found in the literature. For the examples of Brazil and Germany, the effective CO2 reductions have been derived, also considering possible interchange scenarios for production and operation of the PV systems considering the carbon dioxide intensity of the local electricity grids. In the case of Brazil also off-grid applications and the substitution of diesel generating sets by photovoltaics are examined: CO2 reduction may reach 26,805 kg/kWp in that case. Doing these calculations, the compositions of the local grids and their CO2 intensity at the time of PV grid injection have to be taken into account. Also possible changes of the generation fuel mix in the future have to be considered: During the operation time of a PV system, different kinds of power plants could be installed that might change the CO2 intensity of the grid.

abstract = {Photovoltaic installations (PV-systems) are heavily promoted in Europe. In this paper, the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) method is used to find out whether the high subsidy cost can be justified by the environmental benefits. Most existing LCAs of PV only use one-dimensional indicators and are only valid for regions with a high solar irradiation. This paper, however, presents a broad environmental evaluation of residential PV-systems for regions with a rather low solar irradiation of 900-1000 kWh/m2/year, a value typical for Northern Europe and Canada. Based on the Ecoinvent LCA database, six Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods were considered for six different PV-technologies; the comprehensive Eco-Indicator 99 (EI 99) with its three perspectives (Hierarchist, Egalitarian and Individualistic) next to three one-dimensional indicators, namely Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Energy Payback Time (EPT). For regions with low solar irradiation, we found that the EPT is less than 5 years. The Global Warming Potential of PV-electricity is about 10 times lower than that of electricity from a coal fired plant, but 4 times higher when compared to a nuclear power plant or a wind farm. Surprisingly, our results from the more comprehensive EI 99 assessment method do not correlate at all with our findings based on EPT and GWP. The results from the Individualist perspective are strongly influenced by the weighting of the different environmental aspects, which can be misleading. Therefore, to obtain a well-balanced environmental assessment of energy technologies, we recommend a carefully evaluated combination of various impact assessment methods.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that the structure and technology of most modern wind turbines differs little over a wide range of power ratings, results from existing life-cycle assessments of their energy and CO2 intensity show considerable variations. While the range of energy intensities reflects economies of scale, their scatter is due to discrepancies in the energy contents of materials and the analyses' methodology and scope. Furthermore, energy intensities depend crucially on the country of manufacture, turbine recycling or overhaul after the service life, and the choice of tower material. In addition, CO2 intensities vary with national fuel mixes. Measures of life-cycle energy or CO2 emissions can be employed in policy and planning, especially for comparative risk and sustainability assessments, and source switching and capacity growth scenarios. If these measures are to assist decision-making, uncertainties in life-cycle assessments should be minimised by compliance to a standardised methodology, and by use of input-output-based hybrid techniques.},

abstract = {
Concern over the increasing concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere is causing us to re-evaluate how we use energy. In particular, we need to inquire if there are alternative energy systems which discharge less net CO2 per unit of energy service. This paper deals with the CO2 fluxes associated with the use of one biomass fuel, ethanol derived from corn. In a sustainable agricultural system, there is no net CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the corn itself but there is a net CO2 flux due to the fossil-fuel supplements currently used to produce and process corn. A comparison between ethanol from corn and gasoline from crude oil becomes very complex because of the variability of corn yield, the lack of available data on corn processing, and the complexity of treating the multiple products from corn processing. When the comparison is made on an energy content basis only, with no consideration of how the products are to be used, and at the margin of the current U.S. energy system, it appears that there is a net CO2 saving associated with ethanol from corn. This net saving in CO2 emissions may be as large as 40\% or as small as 20\%, depending on how one chooses to evaluate the by-product credits. This analysis also demonstrates that the frequently posed question, whether the energy inputs to ethanol exceed the energy outputs, would not be an over-riding consideration even if it were true, because most of the inputs are as coal and natural gas, whereas the output is as a high-quality liquid fuel.},

A method of extending such analysis to cover dynamic implications of energy input and output has been established and demonstrated through this work. The methodology establishes a dynamic balance between energy input as cumulative energy demand for building new systems and output from available power plants that puts a limit on rate of building new plants. Separate analysis of different technologies in Indian context reveals that this maximum growth rate can be as low as 7.24\% for mono-crystalline photovoltaic systems and as high as 216.7\% for small wind energy systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an environmental comparison based on life cycle assessment (LCA) of the production under average European circumstances and use in The Netherlands of modules based on two kinds of III-V solar cells in an early development stage: a thin-film gallium arsenide (GaAs) cell and a thin-film gallium-indium phosphide/gallium arsenide (GaInP/GaAs) tandem cell. A more general comparison of these modules with the common multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) module is also included. The evaluation of the both III-V systems is made for a limited industrial production scale of 01MWp per year, compared to a scale of about 10MWp per year for the multi-Si system. The here considered III-V cells allow for reuse of the GaAs wafers that are required for their production.The LCA indicates that the overall environmental impact of the production of the III-V modules is larger than the impact of the common multi-Si module production; per category their scores have the same order of magnitude. For the III-V systems the metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) process is the main contributor to the primary energy consumption. The energy payback times of the thin-film GaAs and GaInP/GaAs modules are 50 and 46 years, respectively. For the multi-Si module an energy payback time of 42 years is found. The results for the III-V modules have an uncertainty up to approximately 40\%. The highly comparable results for the III-V systems and the multi-Si system indicate that from an environmental point of view there is a case for further development of both III-V systems.

The OSE Process, from quartz to SGS, is based on a new single-electrode arc furnace, used to produce high quality MGSi, coupled to a refining system to reduce B and P down to the required SGS levels. In particular, the authors compare the specific energy consumption (SEC) and CO2 emissions (COE) for various technologies used in manufacturing this Upgraded Metallurgical Silicon (UMG) SGS. The SEC differences between our SGS process and the current state-of-the-art, ultra high purity polysilicon process, are due to improved thermal efficiency and Si recovery of our arc furnace over conventional 3phase submerged arc silicon furnaces. The overall low cost and cleanliness of our "green" process is due to the superior SEC, high recovery of silicon, low emissions, and recycling of CO gas for power generation.},

abstract = {In this study, the environmental load of photovoltaic power generation system (PV) during its life cycle and energy payback time (EPT) are evaluated by LCA scheme. Two hypothetical case studies in Toyohashi, Japan and Gobi dessert in China have been carried out to investigate the influence of installation location and PV type on environmental load and EPT. The environmental load and EPT of a high-concentration photovoltaic power generation system (hcpV) and a multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic power generation system (mc-Si PV) are studied. The study shows for a PV of 100 MW size, the total impacts of the hcpV installed in Toyohashi is larger than that of the hcpV installed in Gobi desert by 5\% without consideration of recycling stage. The EPT of the hcpV assumed to be installed in Gobi desert is shorter than EPT of the hcpV assumed to be installed in Toyohashi by 0.64 year. From these results, the superiority to install PV in Gobi desert is certificated. Comparing with hcpV and mc-Si PV, the ratio of the total impacts of mc-Si PV to that of hcpV is 0.34 without consideration of recycling stage. The EPT of hcpV is longer than EPT of mc-Si PV by 0.27 year. The amount of global solar radiation contributing to the amount of power generation of mc-Si PV is larger than the amount of direct solar radiation contributing to the amount of power generation of hcpV by about 188 kW h/(m(2) year) in Gobi desert. Consequently, it appears that using mc-Si PV in Gobi desert is the best option. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper assesses modeling parameters that affect the environmental performance of two state-of-the-art photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation technologies: the PVL136 thin film laminates and the KC120 multi-crystalline modules. We selected three metrics to assess the modules' environmental performance, which are part of an actual 33 kW installation in Ann Arbor, MI. The net energy ratio (NER), the energy pay back time (E-PBT), and the CO2 emissions are calculated using process based LCA methods. The results reveal some of the parameters, such as the level of solar radiation, the position of the modules, the modules' manufacturing energy intensity and its corresponding fuel mix, and the solar radiation conversion efficiency of the modules, which affect the final analytical results. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of selected parameters on the final results. For the baseline scenario, the E-PBT for the PVL136 and KC120 are 3.2 and 7.5 years, respectively. When expected future conversion efficiencies are tested, the E-PBT is 1.6 and 5.7 years for the PVL136 and the KC120, respectively. Based on the US fuel mix, the CO2 emissions for the PVL136 and the KC120 are 34.3 and 72.4 g of CO2/kW h, respectively. The most effective way to improve the modules' environmental performance is to reduce the energy input in the manufacturing phase of the modules, provided that other parameters remain constant. Consequently, the use of PV as an electricity source during PV manufacturing is also assessed. The NER of the supplier PV is key for the performance of this scheme. The results show that the NER based on a PV system can be 3.7 times higher than the NER based on electricity supplied by the traditional grid mix, and the CO2 emissions can be reduced by 80\%.},

It is well known that silicon in its various structural configurations (single crystal, multicrystalline, amorphous, micro-nanocrystalline) supplies almost 90\% of the substrates used in the photovoltaic industry. It is also known, since years, that the photovoltaic (PV) industry shows a marked growth trend, which demanded and demands a continuous, huge increase of the bulk silicon supply in the order of 30\%/yr.
In order to fulfill their today- and future needs, many companies worldwide took the decision to start the installation of many thousand tons/year plants, most of them using the Siemens process, some of them using the MG route, to produce the so called solar grade (SG) silicon.
The advantages of the Siemens process are well known, as it provides ultrapure silicon, directly usable for growing either single crystalline Czochralski ingots or multicrystalline ingots using the directional solidification (DS) technique.
The disadvantages are its high energetic cost (a minimum of 120�kWH/kg) and the possible losses of chlorinated gases in the atmosphere, with possible severe environmental problems.
The advantages of the MG route are still potential, as there is no commercially available production of solar silicon as yet, and rely on its reduced energetic costs (a maximum of 25-30�kWh/kg) for a feedstock directly usable for growing multicrystalline ingots using the DS technique. The drawbacks of silicon of MG origin are its larger concentration of metallic impurities, as compared with the Siemens one, the higher B and P content, and the potentially high carbon content.
The aim of this paper is to deal with some of the problems encountered so far with the silicon of MG origin with respect to the metallic and non-metallic impurities content, as well as to propose technologically feasible solar grade feedstock specifications.},

The analysis is consistent with the recommendations provided by ISO norms 14040 and updates, and makes use of an in-house developed multi-method impact assessment method named SUMMA, which includes resource demand indicators, energy efficiency indicators, and “downstream” environmental impact indicators. A comparative framework is also provided, wherein electricity produced by thin film systems such as the ones under study is set up against electricity from poly-Si systems and the average European electricity mix. Results clearly show an overall very promising picture for thin film technologies, which are found to be characterised by favourable environmental impact indicators (with special reference to CdTe systems), in spite of their still comparatively lower efficiencies.},

abstract = {The use of polymer materials for photovoltaic applications is expected to have several advantages over current crystalline silicon technology. In this paper, we perform an environmental and economic assessment of polymer-based thin film modules with a glass substrate and modules with a flexible substrate and we compare our results with literature data for multicrystalline (mc-) silicon photovoltaics and other types of PV. The functional unit of this study is ‘25 years of electricity production by PV systems with a power of 1 watt-peak (Wp)’. Because the lifetime of polymer photovoltaics is at present much lower than of mc-silicon photovoltaics, we first compared the PV cells per watt-peak and next determined the minimum required lifetime of polymer PV to arrive at the same environmental impacts as mc-silicon PV. We found that per watt-peak of output power, the environmental impacts compared to mc-silicon are 20–60\% lower for polymer PV systems with glass substrate and 80–95\% lower for polymer PV with PET as substrate (flexible modules). Also in comparison with thin film CuInSe and thin film silicon, the impacts of polymer modules, per watt-peak, appeared to be lower. The costs per watt-peak of polymer PV modules with glass substrate are approximately 20\% higher compared to mc-silicon photovoltaics. However, taking into account uncertainties, this might be an overestimation. For flexible modules, no cost data were available. If the efficiency and lifetime of polymer PV modules increases, both glass-based and flexible polymer PV could become an environment friendly and cheap alternative to mc-silicon PV.

The paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the electric generation by means of photovoltaic panels. It considers mass and energy flows over the whole production process starting from silica extraction to the final panel assembling, considering the most advanced and consolidate technologies for polycrystalline silicon panel production. Some considerations about the production cycle are reported; the most critical phases are the transformation of metallic silicon into solar silicon and the panel assembling. The former process is characterised by a great electricity consumption, even if the most efficient conversion technology is considered, the latter by the use of aluminium frame and glass roofing, which are very energy-intensive materials. Moreover, the energy pay back time (EPBT) and the potential for CO2 mitigation have been evaluated, considering different geographic collocations of the photovoltaic plant with different values of solar radiation, latitude, altitude and national energetic mix for electricity production.},

In these devices, the PV modules are mounted together with heat recovery units, by which a circulating fluid allows one to cool them down during their operation. An extensive study on water-cooled PV/T solar systems has been conducted at the University of Patras, where hybrid prototypes have been experimentally studied. In this paper the electrical and thermal efficiencies are given and the annual energy output under the weather conditions of Patras is calculated for horizontal and tilted building roof installation. In addition, the costs of all system parts are included and the cost payback time is estimated. Finally, the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to perform an energy and environmental assessment of the analysed system. The goal of this study, carried out at the University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’ by means of SimaPro 5·1 software, was to verify the benefits of heat recovery. The concepts and results of this work on energy performance, economic aspects and LCA results of modified PV and water-cooled PV/T solar systems, give a clear idea of their application advantages. From the results, the most important conclusion is that PV/T systems are cost effective and of better environmental impact compared with standard PV modules.

Most prior net-energy studies of nuclear-power systems accounted only for the direct consumption of fuels and the indirect consumption of energy embodied in physical materials when making such estimates. Most ignored the energy embodied in labor, government, and financial services. In this study, total economic cost is used as a surrogate to estimate the total input-energy cost of constructing, operating, financing, and disposal of nuclear-power systems. Although the cost and performance data used in this study are from light-water reactor systems experience, it is assumed that fast-neutron reactors may be substituted for light-water reactors when economic conditions dictate. We make the conservative assumption that the cost and performance characteristics of fast-neutron reactors will be similar to those of light-water reactors. We conclude that the operation of a large nuclear-power system, involving a continuing construction program of starting one new 1000-MW system each month for 100 yrs, would yield a relatively small amount of net energy, under optimistic assumptions. Under less-optimistic assumptions the net-energy yield is negligible to negative. The average net-energy yield increases, somewhat, when optimistic assumptions are added to account for the possibility of improved efficiency in an all-electric economy.},

A multi-method multi-scale assessment procedure is applied in order to generate consistent performance indicators based on the same set of input data, to ascertain the existence of constraints or crucial steps characterized by low conversion efficiency and to provide the basis for improvement patterns. Optimizing the performance of a given process requires that many different aspects are taken into account. Some of them, mostly of technical nature, relate to the local scale at which the process occurs. Other technological, economic and environmental aspects are likely to affect the dynamics of the larger space and time scales in which the process is embedded. These spatial and time scale effects require that a careful evaluation of the relation between the process and its surroundings is performed, so that hidden consequences and possible sources of inefficiency and impact are clearly identified. In this paper we analyse and compare selected electricity conversion systems, alternative fuels and biofuels, waste management strategies and finally the time evolution of an urban system, in order to show the importance of a multiple perspective point of view for the proper evaluation of a system's environmental and resource use performance.},

@incollection{Yamamoto2005,
abstract = {Summary
With raw materials for crystalline solar cells in increasingly short supply, renewed efforts are being made in the study of ways to make practical thin-film solar cells for use in tomorrow's large-scale solar cell installations. In particular, since thin-film polycrystalline silicon solar cells are made of the same materials as frequently used, bulk silicon solar cells, they are being enthusiastically studied at laboratories worldwide due to the abundance of raw materials for such devices, their stability, and the characteristics they are expected to possess as silicon devices. Part of the motivation behind these studies comes from the theoretical finding that if these devices can be constructed so that they trap sufficient light, it should ideally be possible to achieve photoelectric conversion efficiencies in excess of 20\%, even with solar cells in which the photoelectric layer is just a few micrometres thick [1].},

@article{Zhai2010,
abstract = {This paper advances the life cycle assessment (LCA) of photovoltaic systems by expanding the boundary of the included processes using hybrid LCA and accounting for the technology-driven dynamics of embodied energy and carbon emissions. Hybrid LCA is an extended method that combines bottom-up process-sum and top-down economic input-output (EIO) methods. In 2007, the embodied energy was 4354 MJ/m(2) and the energy payback time (EPBT) was 2.2 years for a multicrystalline silicon PV system under 1700 kWh/m(2)/yr of solar radiation. These results are higher than those of process-sum LCA by approximately 60\%, indicating that processes excluded in process-sum LCA, such as transportation, are significant. Even though PV is a low-carbon technology, the difference between hybrid and process-sum results for 10\% penetration of PV in the U.S. electrical grid is 0.13\% of total current grid emissions. Extending LCA from the process-sum to hybrid analysis makes a significant difference. Dynamics are characterized through a retrospective analysis and future outlook for PV manufacturing from 2001 to 2011. During this decade,the embodied carbon fell substantially, from 60 g CO2/kWh in 2001 to 21 g/kWh in 2011, indicating that technological progress is realizing reductions in embodied environmental impacts as well as lower module price.},
