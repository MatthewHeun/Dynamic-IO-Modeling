\chaptermark{infinite series}

The single-sector economy 
of Figures~\ref{fig:A_materials},~\ref{fig:A_energy},~\ref{fig:A_total_energy_T_dot},
and~\ref{fig:A_value}
can be re-drawn as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:single_sector_flows_3}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Appendix_Infinite_Series/images/I-O_Process_Equivalence.pdf}
\caption{Process flows in a single-sector economy. ***** Mik: please update 
to include Biopshere (0), change ``Sector (2)'' to ``Production (1)'', 
and change all subscripts accordingly. ******}
\label{fig:single_sector_flows_3}
\end{figure}

The economy produces output at a rate of $\dot{X}_{1}$, 
but it requires energy from the biosphere 
($\dot{E}_{01} = a_{01}\dot{X}_{1}$) to do so. 
The economy also consumes a fraction 
of its own gross output 
($\dot{X}_{11} = a_{11}\dot{X}_{1}$). 
To produce $a_{11}\dot{X}_{1}$, 
the economy requires an additional $a_{01}a_{11}\dot{X}_{1}$ 
of energy from the biosphere. 
The sum of all direct energy ($\dot{E}$) required for the economy 
to produce at a rate of $\dot{X}_{1}$ is an infinite sum.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:E_dot_demand_SS}
	\dot{E}_{demand,tot} 
	= a_{01}\dot{X}_{1} 
	+ a_{01}a_{11}\dot{X}_{1} 
	+ a_{01}a_{11}^2\dot{X}_{1} 
	+ \ldots
\end{equation}

The energy intensity of the economy ($\varepsilon_{1}$) is 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsilon_process_SS_intermediate}
	\varepsilon_{1} 
	= \frac{\dot{E}_{demand,tot}}{\dot{X}_{1}} 
	= a_{01}(1 + a_{11} + a_{11}^2 + \ldots) 
	= a_{01}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{11}^{n}.
\end{equation}

Realizing that 
$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{11}^{n} 
= \frac{1}{1-a_{11}}$ 
and 
$a_{01} 
= \frac{\dot{E}_{01}}{\dot{X}_{1}}$ 
(direct energy can be considered the output of the biosphere
in this situation) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsilon_process_SS}
	\varepsilon_{1} = {(1-a_{11})}^{-1} \dot{X}^{-1} \dot{E}_{01}.
\end{equation}

Neglecting 
accumulation of embodied energy in the economy
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \right)$
and depreciation $\left( \gamma_{1}B_{1} = 0 \right)$,
\index{depreciation}
Equations~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} and~\ref{eq:epsilon_process_SS} are identical, 
indicating that the I-O approach accounts 
for the infinite recursion of energy demand by the economy.
