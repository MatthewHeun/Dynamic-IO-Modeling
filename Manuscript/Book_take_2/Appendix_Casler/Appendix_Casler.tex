\chaptermark{column and row vectors}


In this manuscript, we choose to define 
energy intensity ($\bm{\varepsilon}$) and 
energy input ($\vec{E}_{0}$~and~$\vec{T}_{1}$)
as a column vectors (see Equations~\ref{eq:eps_vec_def},~\ref{eq:E_vec_def}, 
and~\ref{eq:T_vec_def}, respectively),
because it natural to solve a system of equations
for a column vector rather than a row vector.
And, Equation~\ref{eq:C-Expanded_Matrix_Form} could not
be written as neatly if $\bm{\varepsilon}$ and $\vec{E}_{0}$
were row vectors.

In contrast, the I-O literature (see, 
e.g.,~\cite{Casler1984}~and~\cite{Bullard:1978vd})
defines energy intensity and energy input
as row vectors. 
The row vs.\ column difference is manifest in the appearance 
of the energy intensity matrix equation.

To demonstrate that our column vector formulation is equivalent 
to the literature's row vector formulation,
this appendix derives a column vector version of the energy intensity equation
that is often found in the literature.
The point of comparison is Casler~\cite{Casler1984}.
Casler's~\cite{Casler1984} energy intensity (Equation 6)
was derived from row vectors 
as\footnote{Equation~\ref{eq:Casler6-converted} is written according
to the variable conventions in this manuscript.
The literal Equation~6 in Casler~\cite{Casler1984} is
$
\varepsilon
= E \hat{X}^{-1} {(I - A)}^{-1}.
$
}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler6-converted}
	\bm{\varepsilon}
	= \vec{E} 
		\hat{\vec{X}}^{-1}
		{(\vec{I} - \vec{A})}^{-1}.
\end{equation}

We begin with Equations~3 and~4 from Casler~\cite{Casler1984},
converted to overdot notation for rates.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler-3}
	\varepsilon_{1} \dot{X}_{11}
	+ \varepsilon_{2} \dot{X}_{21}
	= \varepsilon_{1} \dot{X}_{1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler-4}
	\varepsilon_{1} \dot{X}_{12}
	+ \varepsilon_{2} \dot{X}_{22}
	+ \dot{E}_{02}
	= \varepsilon_{2} \dot{X}_{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Adding an $\dot{E}_{01}$ term\footnote{Note that 
$\dot{E}_{01} = 0$ for Casler~\cite{Casler1984}, 
so $\dot{E}_{0}$ can be included without changing Equation~\ref{eq:Casler-3}.} 
and utilizing matrix notation with column vectors 
(instead of row vectors) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler34-matrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{X}_{11} & \dot{X}_{21} \\
		\dot{X}_{12} & \dot{X}_{22}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	+
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\dot{E}_{01} \\
		\dot{E}_{02}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{X}_{1} & 0 \\
		0           & \dot{X}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Substituting $\dot{X}_{ij} = a_{ij} \dot{X}_{j}$ (from 
Equation~\ref{eq:aij_def}) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler34-matrix-with-a}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		a_{11} \dot{X}_{1} & a_{21} \dot{X}_{1} \\
		a_{12} \dot{X}_{2} & a_{22} \dot{X}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	+
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\dot{E}_{01} \\
		\dot{E}_{02}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{X}_{1} & 0 \\
		0           & \dot{X}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Expanding Equation~\ref{eq:Casler34-matrix-with-a} gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler34-matrix-expanded}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{X}_{1} & 0 \\
		0           & \dot{X}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		a_{11} & a_{21} \\
		a_{12} & a_{22}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	+
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\dot{E}_{01} \\
		\dot{E}_{02}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{X}_{1} & 0 \\
		0           & \dot{X}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\varepsilon_{1} \\
		\varepsilon_{2}
	\end{Bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}With the definitions of $\hat{\vec{X}}$,
$\vec{A}$, $\bm{\varepsilon}$, and $\vec{E}_{0}$
from Equations~\ref{eq:X_hat_matrix_def},
\ref{eq:A_matrix_def},~\ref{eq:E_vec_def}, 
and~\ref{eq:eps_vec_def}, respectively,
we can rewrite Equation~\ref{eq:Casler34-matrix-expanded} as

\begin{equation}
	\hat{\vec{X}} \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \bm{\varepsilon}
	+ \vec{E}_{0}
	= \hat{\vec{X}} \bm{\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Solving for $\bm{\varepsilon}$ gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Casler6-column-vector}
	\bm{\varepsilon}
	= {(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})}^{-1} 
		\hat{\vec{X}}^{-1} 
		\vec{E}_{0}.
\end{equation}

The differences between Equations~\ref{eq:Casler6-converted}
and~\ref{eq:Casler6-column-vector} are due to the choice 
of row vectors (for Equation~\ref{eq:Casler6-converted})
or column vectors (for Equation~\ref{eq:Casler6-column-vector}) only.
Note that Equation~\ref{eq:Casler6-column-vector} is similar
to Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}.
A detailed discussion of the differences 
between Equations~\ref{eq:Casler6-column-vector} and~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}
can be found in Section~\ref{sec:Implications_for_IO}.
