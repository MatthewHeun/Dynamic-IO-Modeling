This Appendix describes the data and calculations used to estimate the value flows to and from the Auto Industry sector in Chapter~\ref{chap:value}. These data are free and available for download from the Bureau of Economic Affairs (BEA) website
and are described in Table~\ref{tab:data_definitions}. The details of the calculations and assumptions made to calculate 
each of the value flows is described in 
Table~\ref{tab:calculations}. **** BRH The following articles will be references in this Appendix.****

KLEMS &
(K-capital, L-labor, E-energy, M-materials, and S-purchased services) refers to broad categories of intermediate inputs that are consumed by industries in their production of goods and services.  The detailed estimates of intermediate inputs of an industry are classified into one of three cost categories—energy, materials, and purchased services; the labor cost category equals an industry’s compensation to labor from value added, and the capital cost category equals the industry’s gross operating surplus plus taxes on production and imports less subsidies.  Detailed information on KLEMS can be found in the September 2005 \emph{ Survey of Current Business} article: \url{http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2005/09September/0905\_Industry.pdf}.

Use Table & 
The Use of Commodities by Industries shows the inputs to industry production and the commodities that are consumed by final users. The supplementary make and use tables are modified standard make and use tables. The modifications, or redefinitions, consist of moving the outputs and inputs of some secondary production activities between industries. Redefinitions, which are necessary for the derivation of the requirements tables, are made in cases where the production process for the secondary product is very dissimilar to that for the industry’s primary product. For example, the production process for restaurant services provided in hotels is very different from that of lodging services. Therefore, for the supplementary tables, the output and inputs for these restaurant services are moved or redefined from the hotel industry to the restaurant industry. The tables are located at \url{http://www.bea.gov/industry/io\_annual.htm}.
