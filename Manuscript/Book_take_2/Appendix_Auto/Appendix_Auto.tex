\chaptermark{Auto value flows}


This Appendix describes the calculations used 
to estimate the value flows to and from the Auto Industry sector 
in Chapter~\ref{chap:value}.  
The details of the calculations and assumptions made to calculate 
each of the value flows is described in Table~\ref{tab:calculations}. 
The data sources are are described in Table~\ref{tab:data_definitions}. 
These data are free and available for download 
from the BEA website.
(See references in Table~\ref{tab:data_definitions}.)

	Fixed Assets that appear to be
	capital made from within the Automobile Industry: 
	Autos, Internal combustion engines, Light trucks (including utility vehicles), 
	Other trucks, buses and truck trailers, 
	Custom software, \& Own account software.\tablefootnote{To confirm 
		that these fixed asset types (particularly ``Custom Software'' and 
		``Own account software'') actually originated from the Auto Industry 
		(that is, that they are truly self-made capital), 
		the I-O ``Make'' table was consulted to ensure 
		that these commodities were made by the Auto Industry.}      \\
&&\\  
Net Economic Output & 333,127   &   2011 Input-Output accounts. 
	The Use of Commodities by Industries before Redefinitions. 
	(Producers' Prices). Total Industry Output, less Self-Use of Capital 
	(\$15,181, calculated above) and less Self-Use of Resources 
	(IOC 3361MV used by IOC 3361MV, \$133,961).\tablefootnote{Note that 
		this self-use of resources is slightly lower than the one used 
		to calculate the total of self-use Resources (\$139,259) 
		that was subtracted from total Material inputs to arrive at a figure 
		for Resources from all other sectors (above). 
		This is because the KLEMS data, like the Fixed Asset data, 
		are more detailed than the standard I-O accounts 
		and may contain judgments and trend estimates.  
		For example, in 2011, the KLEMS total intermediate inputs 
		to the auto industry is higher than the amount

Use Tables & Annual Input-Output accounts. 
	These are the primary industry data collected by the BEA\@.
	The Use tables present what industries use what commodities 
	as intermediate goods, and the value of the commodities that end up as final goods. 
	The values are computed at Producer’s prices. 
	That is, the value includes the sales price, plus sales and excise taxes, 
	less any subsidies. 
	This table provides a link from Industry data to National data. 
	The sum of all final output is a measure of National GDP\@.
	An introduction to these data is available.\cite{Streitwieser:2011aa}
	The tables can be found online.\cite{BEAIOData}\\

KLEMS & (K-capital, L-labor, E-energy, M-materials, and S-purchased services) 
	refers to broad categories of intermediate inputs 
	that are consumed by industries in their production 
	of goods and services.\cite{Strassner:2005aa}
	The detailed estimates of intermediate inputs of an industry 
	are classified into one of three cost categories:
	energy~(E), materials~(M), and purchased services~(S).
	The labor cost category~(L) includes an industry’s compensation to labor from value added, 
	and the capital cost category~(K) includes the industry’s 
	gross operating surplus plus taxes on production and imports less subsidies.  
	The 1998--2011 KLEMS tables can be found online.\cite{BEAKLEMSData}\\

Fixed Assets &  Fixed Assets Table. Detailed Fixed Assets Table. 
	Categorizes capital investment by industry into three categories:
	equipment, structure, and software. 
	To obtain an estimate of self-use of capital, 
	we went to the more detailed tables, 
	which are less reliable than the standard tables. 
	The BEA notes on the detailed tables indicates that 
	``the more detailed estimates are more likely to be based on judgmental trends, 
	on trends in the higher level aggregate, 
	or on less reliable source data.''~\cite[Table~2.5]{BEADetailedData}\\
