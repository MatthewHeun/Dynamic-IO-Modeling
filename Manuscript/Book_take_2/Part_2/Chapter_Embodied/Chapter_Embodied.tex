In Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}, the 
First Law of Thermodynamics\index{First Law of Thermodynamics}
accounted direct energy ($\dot{E}$) flowing among sectors of an economy.
In this chapter, we will adapt the First Law to account  
\emph{embodied} energy\index{embodied energy}\index{energy!embodied|see{embodied energy}}
in the material flows of 
an economy.\footnote{To the authors' knowledge, 
this is the first appearance in the literature 
of a systematic, detailed, and mathematically rigorous derivation 
of embodied energy accounting equations based upon the 
laws of thermodynamics.}

Energy can become ``embodied'' in the output of an economic sector
and within the material in the sector itself.
The energy embodied in the output of an economic sector 
(e.g., energy embodied in the automobiles produced by the automotive sector)
is related to the sum of all direct energy
consumed in the manufacture of its products, including 
all upstream processing stages. It is an indicator of the 
energy demand created by consumption of goods and services
within an economy.

Energy that becomes embodied in the materials of an economic sector 
(such as the machines, factories, and dealerships 
within the automotive sector itself) is essential for 
the efficient operation of the sector. The amount of energy
embodied in the sector is an indicator of the complexity of
the sector; the amount of energy embodied in an entire economy
can be an indicator of the level of 
economic development\index{economic development}
of the economy.

The purpose of this chapter is to develop a model for 
embodied energy flows within economies. 
With an embodied energy model in hand, we will be positioned
to develop a model for the energy intensity 
of goods and services within an economy 
(Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}).


%%%%%%%%%% Embodied Energy: Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:embodied_methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

We begin the derivation of embodied energy accounting
equations by defining the concept of 
\emph{total} energy\index{total energy}\index{energy!total|see{total energy}}. 


%+++++++++ Embodied Energy: Total Energy Accounting ++++++++++
\subsection{Total Energy Accounting}
\label{sec:total_energy_accounting}
%+++++++++

Total energy ($T$) is defined as the sum of 
direct energy\index{direct energy} 
($E$, see Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}) 
and embodied energy ($B$).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_def}
	T \equiv E + B
\end{equation}

The flow rate of total energy ($\dot{T}$) among sectors in 
the economy, the biosphere, and society is the sum of
direct energy ($\dot{E}$) and embodied 
energy ($\dot{B}$).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_dot_def}
	\dot{T} = \dot{E} + \dot{B}
\end{equation}

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:embodied_single_producer} illustrates
that total energy flows are comprised of
direct energy ($\dot{E}$) and embodied energy ($\dot{B}$). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Embodied/images/PERKS_basic_unit_embodied_energy_content.pdf}
	\caption{Total energy flows for a single sector of an economy. 
	For the sake of clarity, 
	embodied ($\dot{B}$) and direct ($\dot{E}$) energy
	are shown separately for material inflows from other sectors only.}
	\label{fig:embodied_single_producer}
\end{figure}

**** Clarify why only $\dot{E}$ terms on extracted
streams and only $\dot{B}$ terms on wastes. ****

**** Make a point about minimizing magnitude of 
direct energy waste streams. ****

**** what about the embodied energy
of scrap metal from auto industry? ****

In some cases, a material flow may include 
either direct energy ($\dot{E}$) 
or embodied energy ($\dot{B}$), exclusive. 
For example, the flow of extracted crude oil from the earth 
consists of direct energy only ($\dot{B} = 0$ and $\dot{T} = \dot{E}$), 
because, in this method, no embodied energy ($B$) is added 
to the crude oil until it reaches the downstream side of the oil rig.
The material produced by a non-energy sector of the economy 
consists of indirect energy only ($\dot{E} \approx 0$, 
and therefore $\dot{T} \approx \dot{B}$), 
because direct energy ($E$) produced by 
a non-energy sector is negligible in this economy. 

In other cases, a material flow may include both direct energy flow
($\dot{E}$) \emph{and} embodied energy flow ($\dot{B}$) components.
For example, the outgoing flow of refined petroleum from the energy sector 
has both a direct energy ($\dot{E}$, the energy content of the oil product, 
usually represented by chemical potential energy) 
and embodied energy ($\dot{B}$, which accounts for the energy 
consumed in upstream processes 
to extract and refine the crude oil).\footnote{Outputs from 
agricultural sectors will be similar: 
both the direct energy component (comprising chemical potential energy) 
and the embodied energy component (representing upstream
energy consumed in food production) will be non-zero.}

Most of the I-O literature \cite{Bullard1975, Herendeen1978} 
[REF TO BULLARD AND HERENDEEN, ETC. HERE --MKH] assumes the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) are 
	\emph{conserved},\footnote{Total energy 
	can be neither created nor destroyed.}

	\item steady state conditions exist 
	(i.e., total energy does not accumulate in economic 
	sectors),\footnote{We will see later how the
	steady-state assumption in the literature 
	can introduce errors into I-O analyses.} and
	
	\item the sum of the signed 
	(input is positive, output is negative) 
	total energy inflows of a sector
	is assigned to the products of the sector (i.e., 
	there is no ``waste'' of total energy).
\end{enumerate}

Like the I-O literature, we assume that total energy is conserved
and never wasted.\footnote{Of course, waste heat exists and is
accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. However,
waste heat is ignored when accounting for total energy.}
However, we depart from the I-O literature to allow durability of goods 
as represented by total energy accumulation in economic sectors. 
Steady state, this approach is not. 

Total energy ($T$) may accumulate within an economic sector 
as stocks of direct energy materials 
(piles of coal or tanks of oil) 
but also as energy embodied in stocks of capital goods 
(e.g., machinery or buildings). 
The rate of accumulation of total energy 
in a sector of the economy, the biosphere, 
or society is given by the time derivative of total energy:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_accum_def}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}.
\end{equation}

The following equation provides a total energy accounting 
for a sector of the economy, where the $\dot{T}$ terms
are signed: positive for total energy input and negative
for total energy output.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:total_energy_accounting}
		\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t}
		= \sum \dot{T}
\end{equation}

By substituting Equations~\ref{eq:T_dot_def} and
\ref{eq:T_accum_def} into 
Equation~\ref{eq:total_energy_accounting},
we obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:total_energy_accounting_details}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum{\left( \dot{E} 
			+ \dot{B} \right)}.
\end{equation}


%+++++++++ Embodied Energy: Embodied Energy Accounting ++++++++++
\subsection{Embodied Energy Accounting}
%+++++++++

We note that the definition of total energy 
(Equation \ref{eq:T_def}) includes direct energy ($E$) 
and embodied energy ($B$) terms. 
On the other hand, the First Law of Thermodynamics 
(Equation~\ref{eq:First_Law_with_accumulation})
includes direct energy ($E$) and waste heat ($Q$) terms. 
The consequence of the foregoing difference is that 
an interesting relationship exists between embodied energy ($B$) 
and waste heat ($Q$). 

To derive an accounting equation for embodied energy, we substitute the 
First Law of Thermodynamics (Equation~\ref{eq:First_Law_with_accumulation})
into the total energy accounting equation (Equation~\ref{eq:total_energy_accounting_details}).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:embodied_energy_accounting}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum \dot{B} 
	+ \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

The waste energy terms ($\dot{Q}_{out}$) 
in Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting}
are \emph{outflows} of energy from the sector. 
The embodied energy 
terms ($\dot{B}$) represent embodied energy of either inflows
or outflows of material. Splitting the $\dot{B}$ term
into inflows and outflows gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum \dot{B}_{in}
	- \sum \dot{B}_{out} 
	+ \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

In words, the rate of accumulation of embodied energy 
in a sector of the economy 
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ 
is equal to the sum of the rates of 
inflow of embodied energy into the sector 
	($\dot{B}_{in}$) 
less the rate of output of embodied energy from the sector 
	($\dot{B}_{out}$) 
\emph{plus} the rate of waste direct energy from the sector 
	($\dot{Q}_{out}$). 
The first two terms on the right side of
Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2} are expected: 
accumulation is the difference between inflow and outflow rates. 
Rearranging Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}
yields another useful version of the equation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_3}
	\sum \dot{B}_{out}
	= \sum \dot{B}_{in}
	- \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \sum \dot{Q}_{out},
\end{equation}

\noindent and we see that the waste direct energy term 
($+\ \dot{Q}_{out}$) is \emph{additive} to both accumulation 
of embodied energy in a sector of the economy
(Equation \ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}) and 
outflow of embodied energy from a sector of the economy 
(Equation \ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_3}). 
Furthermore, because the waste direct energy 
($\dot{Q}_{out}$) appears 
in the embodied energy output from a sector, 
waste heat accumulates along each step of a process 
such that the energy embodied in a product 
is the \emph{sum} of waste heats along 
its upstream process path.

Equations~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}
and \ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_3} are generalized
embodied energy accounting equations that we will
apply to Examples~A--C in the sections that follow.


%%%%%%%%%% Embodied Energy: Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example A: single-sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Figure \ref{fig:A_total_energy_T_dot} shows the flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) through the single-sector economy.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Embodied/images/1_sector_embodied_energy.pdf}

**** Mik: Can you edit this figure include only $\dot{T}$ flows everywhere?
--MKH ****}
\label{fig:A_total_energy_T_dot}
\end{figure}

As discussed above, we follow the I-O literature in assuming that 
total energy ($T$) is conserved. 
A total energy accounting around the biosphere (1)
and the single-sector economy (2) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_T_acct_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{T}_{21} 
	- \dot{T}_{12},
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_T_acct_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{T}_{12} 
	- \dot{T}_{21}.
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations~\ref{eq:T_dot_def} and
\ref{eq:T_accum_def} into 
Equations~\ref{eq:A_T_acct_1} and \ref{eq:A_T_acct_2}
yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_total_energy_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{21} 
	- \dot{E}_{12}
	- \dot{B}_{12}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_total_energy_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{12} 
	+ \dot{B}_{12} 
	- \dot{E}_{21}
	- \dot{B}_{21}.	
\end{equation}

At this point, we can proceed in two directions with the derivation.
The first, involving simplifying Equations~\ref{eq:A_total_energy_1}
and \ref{eq:A_total_energy_2}, is intuitive.
A second approach, involving substituting the First Law
into Equations~\ref{eq:A_total_energy_1} and \ref{eq:A_total_energy_2}
provides the advantage of canceling direct energy terms 
in the embodied energy accounting equation.
We begin with simplification.


%+++++++++ Simplified embodied energy ++++++++++
\subsection{Simplification of the embodied energy accounting equation} % (fold)
\label{sec:A_simplified_embodied}
%+++++++++

To simplify Equations~\ref{eq:A_total_energy_1} and \ref{eq:A_total_energy_2},
we first realize that, by definition, no embodied energy flows from 
the earth with extracted material, so $\dot{B}_{12} = 0$.
Second, we can assume that direct energy ($E$) does not accumulate
in the economy such that 
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$ and
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$.
Finally, we note that $\dot{E}_{21} = 0$, 
because society does not supply direct energy 
to the biosphere. Thus, Equations~\ref{eq:A_total_energy_1}
and \ref{eq:A_total_energy_2} become

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_total_energy_1_simp}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{B}_{21} 
	- \dot{E}_{12}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_total_energy_2_simp}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{12} 
	- \dot{B}_{21}.	
\end{equation}

These equations show that direct energy consumed by a 
sector ($\dot{E}_{12}$) increases the energy embodied within the sector, 
whereas the waste from the sector produces an embodied
energy outflow ($\dot{B}_{21}$). 
The total energy flows of Figure~\ref{fig:A_total_energy_T_dot}
become slightly clearer with these simplifications. (See 
Figure~\ref{fig:A_total_energy_simp}.)

%+++++++++ First Law embodied energy ++++++++++
\subsection{Substitution of First Law into the embodied energy accounting equation} % (fold)
\label{sec:A_first_law_embodied}
%+++++++++

The second approach to the derivation of embodied energy
accounting equations is to substitute the First Law
(Equations~\ref{eq:dE_1/dt_single_sector} and \ref{eq:dE_2/dt_single_sector}) 
into the total energy accounting equations 
(Equations~\ref{eq:A_total_energy_1} and \ref{eq:A_total_energy_2}). 
This approach has the advantage of canceling all 
First Law direct energy terms from the embodied energy accounting equations.
And, it is no longer necessary to assume that the 
accumulation rate of direct energy 
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
is zero.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_dB1/dt}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{21}
	+ \dot{B}_{21} 
	- \dot{B}_{12}
	- \dot{Q}_{21}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_dB2/dt}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{B}_{12} 
	- \dot{E}_{21}
	- \dot{B}_{21}
	+ \dot{Q}_{21}
\end{equation}

Note that the Equation~\ref{eq:A_dB1/dt} includes the
term $-\dot{Q}_{21}$, which, at first glance,
appears different from 
Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}.\footnote{Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}
has a positive sign for the waste energy term (+ $\dot{Q}_{out}$),
whereas Equation~\ref{eq:A_dB1/dt} has a 
negative sign for the waste energy term ($- \dot{Q}_{21}$).}
However, upon realizing that $\dot{Q}_{21}$ is an \emph{inflow}
of waste energy into the biosphere, we can use $\dot{Q}_{21} = - \dot{Q}_{12}$
to rewrite Equation~\ref{eq:A_dB1/dt} with an \emph{outflow} 
term,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_dB1/dt_waste_outflow}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{21}
	+ \dot{B}_{21} 
	- \dot{B}_{12}
	+ \dot{Q}_{12},
\end{equation}

\noindent thereby maintining consistency with
Equation~\ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting_2}.

We can simplify 
Equations~\ref{eq:A_dB1/dt} and \ref{eq:A_dB2/dt} 
using the assumptions of Section~\ref{sec:A_simplified_embodied} 
(namely, that $\dot{B}_{12} = 0$ and $\dot{E}_{21} = 0$)
to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_dB1/dt_simp}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{B}_{21} 
	- \dot{Q}_{21}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_dB2/dt_simp}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= - \dot{B}_{21}
	+ \dot{Q}_{21},
\end{equation}

\noindent the embodied energy accounting equations for 
Example~A.

In Examples~B and C following, we will choose to substitute
the First Law into the embodied energy accounting equations,
because of the benefit of canceling direct energy terms. 
We turn now to Example~B, a two-sector economy.

%%%%%%%%%% Embodied Energy: Example B %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two-sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

For the two-sector economy of Figures~\ref{fig:B_materials}
and \ref{fig:B_energy}, we again follow the I-O literature 
by assuming that total energy ($T$) is conserved. 
Figure~\ref{fig:B_total_energy} shows total energy
flows for the two-sector economy.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Embodied/images/2_sector_embodied_energy.pdf}
\caption{Flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) in a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_total_energy}
\end{figure}

Accounting for accumulation of total energy and using the assumption 
that total energy is conserved, we can write the following equations.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_T_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{21} 
	+ \dot{T}_{31} 
	- \dot{T}_{13},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_T_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{32} 
	- \dot{T}_2
	- \dot{T}_{21},
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_T_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{13} 
	+ \dot{T}_{23}
	+ \dot{T}_{33} 
	- \dot{T}_{3} 
	- \dot{T}_{31}.
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations~\ref{eq:T_dot_def} 
and \ref{eq:T_accum_def} into 
Equations~\ref{eq:CV_T_1} through
\ref{eq:C-CV_T_3} gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_dB_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{21} 
	+ \dot{E}_{31} 
	+ \dot{B}_{31} 
	- \dot{E}_{13} 
	- \dot{B}_{13},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_dB_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{32} 
	+ \dot{B}_{32} 
	- \dot{E}_2
	- \dot{B}_2
	- \dot{E}_{21} 
	- \dot{B}_{21},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_dB_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{13} 
	+ \dot{B}_{13} 
	+ \dot{E}_{23}
	+ \dot{B}_{23}
	+ \dot{E}_{33} 
	+ \dot{B}_{33} 
	- \dot{E}_{3} 
	- \dot{B}_{3} 
	- \dot{E}_{31} 
	- \dot{B}_{31}.
\end{equation}

As in Example~A, we can substitute the First Law of Thermodynamics 
(Equations~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_3}--\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_2})
into the total energy accounting equations
(Equations~\ref{eq:CV_dB_1}--\ref{eq:CV_dB_3}) 
and employ the assumptions that 
$\dot{E}_{i1} = 0$ and
$\dot{B}_{1j} = 0$ 
to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:B_embodied_energy_accounting_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{B}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{31} 
	- \dot{Q}_{21} 
	- \dot{Q}_{31}, 
\end{equation}

**** Verify the following equations ****

\begin{equation} \label{eq:B_embodied_energy_accounting_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{Q}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{32} 
	- \dot{B}_{21},
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:B_embodied_energy_accounting_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_3}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{Q}_{31} 
	+ \dot{B}_{13} 
	+ \dot{B}_{33} 
	- \dot{B}_{31}.
\end{equation}

Similar to Example~A, we observe that the accumulation rate 
of embodied energy in the Goods and Services sector (3) 
is the sum of the rates of waste heat from the sector 
($\dot{Q}_{31}$) and embodied energy into the sector 
($\dot{B}_{13} + \dot{B}_{33}$) 
less the rate of embodied energy leaving the sector 
on its output stream ($\dot{B}_{31}$).

In the next section, we apply embodied energy accounting to 
Example~C, a three-sector economy.

Again, we begin with a diagram showing total energy ($\dot{T}$) flows

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_T_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{32} 
	+ \dot{T}_{42} 
	- \dot{T}_{21},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_T_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{13} 
	+ \dot{T}_{33} 
	+ \dot{T}_{43} 
	- \dot{T}_{3} 
	- \dot{T}_{31},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_T_4}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{4}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{T}_{14} 
	+ \dot{T}_{34} 
	+ \dot{T}_{44} 
	- \dot{T}_{4} 
	- \dot{T}_{41}.
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations~\ref{eq:T_dot_def} 
and \ref{eq:T_accum_def} into 
Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_T_1} through
\ref{eq:C-CV_T_4} gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_dB_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{E}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{21} 
	+ \dot{E}_{31} 
	+ \dot{B}_{31} 
	+ \dot{E}_{41} 
	+ \dot{B}_{41} 
	- \dot{E}_{13} 
	- \dot{B}_{13} 
	- \dot{E}_{14} 
	- \dot{B}_{14},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_dB_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{32} 
	+ \dot{B}_{32} 
	+ \dot{E}_{42} 
	+ \dot{B}_{42} 
	- \dot{E}_{21} 
	- \dot{B}_{21},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_dB_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{13} 
	+ \dot{B}_{13} 
	+ \dot{E}_{33} 
	+ \dot{B}_{33} 
	+ \dot{E}_{43} 
	+ \dot{B}_{43} 
	- \dot{E}_{3} 
	- \dot{B}_{3} 
	- \dot{E}_{31} 
	- \dot{B}_{31},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_dB_4}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{4}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{4}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{14} 
	+ \dot{B}_{14} 
	+ \dot{E}_{34} 
	+ \dot{B}_{34}
	+ \dot{E}_{44} 
	+ \dot{B}_{44} 
	- \dot{E}_{4} 
	- \dot{B}_{4} 
	- \dot{E}_{41} 
	- \dot{B}_{41}.
\end{equation}

Substituting the First Law of Thermodynamics 
(Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_4_simp} through \ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_3}) 
into the total energy accounting equations 
(Equations \ref{eq:C-CV_dB_1} through \ref{eq:C-CV_dB_4}) 
gives embodied energy accounting equations for Example~C.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-embodied_acct_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{B}_{21} 
	+ \dot{B}_{31} 
	+ \dot{B}_{41} 
	- \dot{B}_{13} 
	- \dot{B}_{14} 
	- \dot{Q}_{21} 
	- \dot{Q}_{31} 
	- \dot{Q}_{41}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-embodied_acct_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{B}_{32} 
	+ \dot{B}_{42} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{21} 
	- \dot{B}_{21}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-embodied_acct_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{B}_{13} 
	+ \dot{B}_{33} 
	+ \dot{B}_{43} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{31} 
	- \dot{B}_{3} 
	- \dot{B}_{31}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-embodied_acct_4}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{4}}{\mathrm{d}t}	 
	= \dot{B}_{14} 
	+ \dot{B}_{34} 
	+ \dot{B}_{44} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{41} 
	- \dot{B}_{4} 
	- \dot{B}_{41}
\end{equation}

To verify the above derivation, 
we sum Equations~\ref{eq:C-embodied_acct_1} through 
\ref{eq:C-embodied_acct_4} 
and use the following identities:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-B_sum_3_output}
	\dot{B}_3 
	= \dot{B}_{32} 
	+ \dot{B}_{33} 
	+ \dot{B}_{34}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-B_sum_4_output}
	\dot{B}_4 
	= \dot{B}_{42} 
	+ \dot{B}_{43} 
	+ \dot{B}_{44};
\end{equation}

\noindent to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-B_sums_to_zero}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{4}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= 0,
\end{equation}

\noindent as expected. The total embodied energy content of the system 
(biosphere (1), society (2), energy sector (3), and goods and services sector (4)) 
remains constant with respect to time.
