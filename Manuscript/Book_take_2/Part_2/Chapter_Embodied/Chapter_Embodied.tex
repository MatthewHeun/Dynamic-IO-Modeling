%%%%%%%%%% Embodied Energy: Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:embodied_methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

In Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}, the First Law of Thermodynamics
was used to account for direct energy flowing through sectors of an economy.
In this chapter, we will adapt the First Law to account  
\emph{embodied} energy. 
The embodied energy ($B$) of the output 
of an economic sector 
is the sum total of all direct energy
consumed in its manufacture, including 
all upstream processing stages. 
We begin the derivation of embodied energy accounting
equations by defining \emph{total} energy. 


%+++++++++ Embodied Energy: Total Energy Accounting ++++++++++
\subsection{Total Energy Accounting}
\label{sec:total_energy_accounting}
%+++++++++

Total energy ($T$) is defined as the sum of the direct energy 
(see Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}) 
and embodied energy.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_def}
	T \equiv E + B
\end{equation}

The flow rate of total energy among sectors in 
the economy, the biosphere, and society is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_dot_def}
	\dot{T} = \dot{E} + \dot{B}.
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:embodied_single_producer} shows that
total energy flows are comprised of direct energy ($\dot{E}$)
and embodied energy ($\dot{B}$). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Embodied/images/TotalEnergyOneProducer.pdf}
	\caption{Total energy flows for a single sector of an economy. 
	For the sake of clarity, 
	embodied ($\dot{B}$) and direct ($\dot{E}$) energy
	are shown separately only for material flows from other sectors.
	**** Mik: Can you make a figure that looks like this? 
	But, the waste streams should not be present. 
	I made a mistake to include them. **** --Matt}
	\label{fig:embodied_single_producer}
\end{figure}

In some cases, total energy flows ($\dot{T}$) 
may consist of direct energy ($\dot{E}$) 
or embodied energy ($\dot{B}$) exclusively. 
For example, the flow of extracted crude oil from the earth 
consists of direct energy only ($\dot{B} = 0$ and $\dot{T} = \dot{E}$), 
because, in this method, no embodied energy ($B$) is added 
to the crude oil until it reaches the downstream side of the oil rig.
The material produced by a non-energy sector of the economy 
consists of indirect energy only ($\dot{E} \approx 0$, 
and therefore $\dot{T} \approx \dot{B}$), 
because direct energy ($E$) produced by 
a non-energy sector is negligible in this economy. 

In other cases, total energy flows may have both direct 
\emph{and} indirect components. 
For example, the flow of refined petroleum from the energy sector 
has both a direct energy ($\dot{E}$, the energy content of the oil product, 
usually represented by chemical potential energy) 
and embodied energy ($\dot{B}$, which accounts for the energy 
consumed in upstream processes 
to extract and refine the crude oil).\footnote{Outputs from 
agricultural sectors will be similar: 
both the direct energy component (comprising chemical potential energy) 
and the embodied energy component will be non-zero.}

Most of the I-O literature \cite{Bullard1975, Herendeen1978} 
[REF TO BULLARD AND HERENDEEN, ETC. HERE --MKH] assumes the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) are 
	\emph{conserved},\footnote{Total energy 
	can be neither created nor destroyed.}
	
	\item the sum total of the total energy input to a sector
	appears in the products of the sector (i.e., 
	there is no ``waste'' of total energy), and
	
	\item steady state conditions exist 
	(i.e., total energy does not accumulate in economic sectors).
\end{enumerate}

Like the I-O literature, we assume that total energy is conserved
and never wasted.\footnote{Of course, waste heat exists and is
accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. However,
waste heat is ignored when accounting for total energy.}
However, we depart from the literature to allow durability of goods 
as represented by total energy accumulation in economic sectors. 
Steady state, this approach is not.

Total energy may accumulate within an economic sector 
as stocks of direct energy materials 
(piles of coal or tanks of oil) 
but also as energy embodied in stocks of capital goods 
(e.g. machinery or buildings). 
The rate of accumulation of total energy 
$\left( \frac{dT}{dt} \right)$
in a sector of the economy, the biosphere, 
or society is given by the time derivative of total energy:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_accum_def}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}.
\end{equation}

We note that the definition of total energy 
(Equation \ref{eq:T_def}) includes direct energy ($E$) 
and embodied energy ($B$) terms. 
On the other hand, the First Law of Thermodynamics 
includes direct energy ($E$) and 
waste heat ($Q$) terms. 
The consequence of the foregoing difference is that 
an interesting relationship exists between embodied energy ($B$) 
and waste heat ($Q$). 
We shall see below that waste heat 
from an economic sector is additive to energy embodied
in the products of the sector.
