In Chapter \ref{chap:intro}, we formulated a model of economies
consisting of producers and consumers who exchange
goods and services and factors of production 
while extracting resources and disposing of wastes. 
In Chapter \ref{chap:materials}, we established the material basis of economies: 
economies are analogous to organisms with metabolisms that processes
raw resources for the benefit of producers and consumers 
while generating unavoidable wastes.
In this chapter, we describe and analyze the 
direct energy\index{direct energy}\index{energy!direct|see{direct energy}}
that is associated with material flows
through an economy.

All forms of energy provide the potential to do mechanical work. The 
quantification of the mechanical work potential of energy is \emph{exergy}\index{exergy}.
When energy is ``consumed'' by an economy, exergy (work potential) is destroyed. 
Energy (as work potential) 
is an essential aspect of the metabolic economy;
with it, materials are refined, shaped, and assembled
into useful intermediate and consumption products; 
food is made available to people in society; 
jobs are made easier for workers;
human ingenuity is multiplied;
and complex systems and civilizations are possible.
In the absence of high rates of energy availablity at low cost,
life becomes much more difficult, even impossible, for many people.

Our analogy is this: 
energy is to thermodynamics as currency is to financial accounting.
In other words, energy is the currency of thermodynamics.
Just as an accountant understands a firm by watching how and where
currency flows through it, so we can understand an economy by watching
how and where energy flows through it.
Accounting for energy flows through an economy
is essential for developing a dynamic picture 
of its metabolism.

The purpose of this chapter is to develop 
a model for energy flows within economies.
With an energy model in hand, we will be positioned 
to assess the rate at which
energy becomes embodied within the products and 
services that an economy provides
(Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}).

%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:energy_methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

We begin by noting that direct energy travels 
with material through an economy.
``Direct'' energy refers to forms of energy accounted by the 
First Law of Thermodynamics\index{First Law of Thermodynamics}\index{Thermodynamics!First Law of|see{First Law of Thermodynamics}},
including chemical potential energy\index{chemical energy}\index{energy!chemical|see{chemical energy}}, 
nuclear potential energy\index{nuclear energy}\index{energy!nuclear|see{nuclear energy}}, 
gravitational potential energy\index{gravitational energy}\index{energy!gravitational|see{gravitational energy}},
thermal energy\index{thermal energy}\index{energy!thermal|see{thermal energy}}, 
and kinetic energy\index{kinetic energy}\index{energy!kinetic|see{kinetic energy}}.
We use the term ``direct'' energy distinct from ``embodied'' energy, 
which will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:embodied_energy}.
Examples of direct energy flows include 
the chemical potential energy of coal\index{coal} inflows to an energy sector, 
the thermal energy of process steam\index{steam} into a textile plant, and
the thermal energy of CO$_2$ automobile exhaust.
In each case, the material (coal, steam, and CO$_2$) 
carries direct energy with it.\footnote{Even 
radiative thermal energy\index{radiative energy}
can be considered a material flow (photons) that carries
direct energy (thermal) with it.}
Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content} shows a corresponding 
direct energy flow for each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/PERKS_basic_unit_energy_content.pdf}
\caption{Energy content ($\dot{E}$) of material flows 
($\dot{R}$, $\dot{S}$, and $\dot{K}$) 
from Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}.}
\label{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
\end{figure}

For any boundary (around, say, a machine, a plant,
a sector of the economy, or the entire economy itself), 
the First Law of Thermodynamics says that 
the accumulation rate of direct energy ($E$) within the boundary
is equal to the sum of the signed direct energy flow rates ($\dot{E}$)
across the boundary (where inflows are positive and outflows are negative)
less outflowing energy carried by wastes ($\dot{Q}_{out}$): 
energy is conserved.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_with_accumulation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum \dot{E} - \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

When there is no accumulation of direct energy within the boundary
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \right)$, the sum of all 
signed direct energy flow rates ($\dot{E}$) 
and waste heats ($\dot{Q}_{out}$) will be zero.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_no_accumulation}
	0 = \sum \dot{E} - \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the direct energy associated with some material flows can
be so small as to be negligible compared to other direct energy flows in the economy.
For example, the direct energy of steel into the automobile sector of the economy 
is almost negligible. (The \emph{embodied} energy of the steel is almost certainly
\emph{not} negligible, as will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.)
On the other hand, the direct energy flow rates for 
fossil fuels\index{fossil fuels}
(coal, oil, and natural gas)
are typically orders of magnitude larger than any other 
material flows due to large chemical potential energy content.

To simplify the direct energy analysis, 
we can aggregate the direct energy flows of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
into single arrows when appropriate. 
For example, the direct energy inputs from other sectors of the economy
(labeled as $\dot{E}_{\dot{R}}$, $\dot{E}_{\dot{S}}$, and $\dot{E}_{\dot{K}}$ 
at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}) can be summed to $\dot{E}$ 
(in Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy}) such that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:direct_energy_aggregation}
	\dot{E}_{\mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy}}} 
	= \dot{E}_{\dot{R}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{S}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{K}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/PERKS_basic_unit_energy.pdf}
\caption{Aggregated direct energy flow rates around 
the producer of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}.}
\label{fig:PERKS_energy}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example A: single-sector economy}
\label{sec:A_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Aggregated direct energy flows are now applied to Example A, 
the single-sector economy shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}.
By summing the direct energy flows associated with
each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}, we obtain
a simplified picture of direct energy flows in the economy,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}.\footnote{Single 
subscripts on quantities such as
$E$ can mean one of two things: 
$\dot{E}_{i}$ indicates the outflow of direct energy from sector $i$, 
whereas $E_{i}$ denotes the direct energy content of sector $i$. 
Double subscripts on quantities
(e.g., $\dot{E}_{ij}$) indicate a flow 
from sector $i$ to sector $j$. 
The first index always indicates the sector \emph{from} which a quantity flows, 
and the second index indicates the sector \emph{to} which a quantity flows.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/1_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption{Direct energy flow rates for Example A, the single-sector economy.}
\label{fig:A_energy}
\end{figure}

We distinguish useful direct energy inputs to a sector of the economy
($\dot{E}_{01}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}) from wasteful direct energy flows 
($\dot{Q}_{10}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}), 
because $\dot{Q}$ typically denotes thermal energy, 
and many waste energy flows are in the form of thermal
energy, i.e., waste heat. In Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}, direct energy input to the 
economy ($\dot{E}_{01}$) is shown as being extracted from the biosphere, because
the vast majority of direct energy today is derived from fossil fuels.
Waste heat from the economy ($\dot{Q}_{10}$) is shown as returning 
to the biosphere.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:energy_methodology}, 
both direct energy ($\dot{E}$), and waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) 
are accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. 
Accounting for possible accumulation of direct energy, 
the First Law of Thermodynamics for Example~A indicates that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_0/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_0}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	- \dot{E}_{01}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_1/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{01} 
	+ \dot{E}_{11}
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

Note that $\dot{E}_{1}$ is the gross direct energy production rate
of society. 
For example, firms extract crude oil (a component of $\dot{E}_{01}$) 
and refine it into petroleum products (a component of $\dot{E}_{1}$)
that are consumed by society.
The direct energy consumption of extraction and refining firms 
is a component of $\dot{E}_{11}$.

Aside from, for example, the U.S. 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve\index{Strategic Petroleum Reserve}, 
we are not stockpiling oil and coal at any meaningful rate, 
i.e. we consume fossil fuels at a rate equal to their extraction rate. 
Thus, the world is not accumulating direct energy 
in the economy.\footnote{A counter-example could be made 
for nuclear fuels where ``spent'' fuel represents a large exergetic stockpile. 
However, this reserve is not (presently) economically useful.} 
(The world \emph{is}, however, 
accumulating \emph{embodied} energy\index{embodied energy} 
in the economy as we shall see 
in Chapter \ref{chap:embodied_energy}.) 
Thus, the accumulation rates for direct energy 
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ in the above equations 
could be set to zero as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:biosphere_direct_energy_steady_state}
	0 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	- \dot{E}_{01}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_direct_energy_steady_state}
	0 
	= \dot{E}_{01} 
	+ \dot{E}_{11}
	- \dot{E}_{1} 
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

However, we shall see later (in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}) 
that keeping direct energy accumulation terms
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\dot{E}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ 
provides an advantage when deriving embodied energy accounting equations.


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example B %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two-sector economy}
\label{sec:B_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

For Example~B, we split an economic sector (2) from 
society (1). Figure~\ref{fig:B_energy} shows aggregated
direct energy flows associated with the material flows of Figure~\ref{fig:B_materials}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/2_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption{Direct energy flows for Example B, a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_energy}
\end{figure}

The First Law of Thermodynamics
requires that both 
direct energy and 
waste heat\index{waste heat} 
be conserved around each 
entity (1 and 2) as well as around the biosphere (0).

First Law energy accounting around the biosphere (0) and society (1) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_0}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	=  \dot{Q}_{10} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{20} 
	- \dot{E}_{02},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{11} 
	+ \dot{E}_{21}
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

Note that $\dot{E}_{12}$ represents useful work that people
and draught animals contribute to the economy (2). 
\citet{Ayres:2003ec} and \citet{Warr:2012cg} call this ``muscle work.'' 
$\dot{E}_{11}$ represents the muscle work required
for consumption. Direct energy required for consumption 
by final demand (electricity, oil, natural gas, etc.)
is included in $\dot{E}_{21}$.

The First Law around the economy (2), 
including the accumulation rate of direct energy in the sector 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$, yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{02} 
	+ \dot{E}_{12}
	+ \dot{E}_{22} 
	- \dot{E}_{2} 
	- \dot{Q}_{20}.
\end{equation}

\noindent It is notable that the economy (2) consumes ($\dot{E}_{22}$)
a portion of its gross energy output ($\dot{E}_2$): it takes energy to make energy.

Equation~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_0} can be generalized with a sum as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_biosphere_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left( \dot{Q}_{i0} - \dot{E}_{0i} \right),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the number of economic sectors in the model
(in this example, $n = 2$).
Similarly, Equations~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_1} and \ref{eq:CV_E_dot_2} 
can generalized with a sum as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:B-CV_E_econ_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=0}^n\dot{E}_{ij} 
	- \dot{E}_{j}  
	- \dot{Q}_{j0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j \in [1, n]$.


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example C %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example C: three-sector economy}
\label{sec:C_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

We can extend Example~B, to include an energy sector (2) 
and a goods and services sector (3), thereby obtaining
a fuller picture of direct energy flows among sectors
(Figure \ref{fig:C_energy}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/3_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption{Direct energy flows in Example C: a three-sector economy.}
\label{fig:C_energy}
\end{figure}

We note that the gross direct energy production of the energy sector (2) is 
$\dot{E}_{2}$, and the direct energy consumption of the energy sector (2) is 
$\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22} + \dot{E}_{32}$. 
The net direct energy production by the energy sector (2)
is given by $\dot{E}_{2} - (\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22} + \dot{E}_{32})$.
The energy return on investment\index{energy return on investment|see{EROI}} 
($EROI$)\index{EROI} of the energy sector (2) is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-EROI}
	EROI_2 
	= \frac{\dot{E}_{2}}{\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22} + \dot{E}_{32}}.
\end{equation}

The First Law of Thermodynamics around the 
biosphere (0), society (1), and the energy sector (2) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_0}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{20} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{30} 
	- \dot{E}_{02} 
	- \dot{E}_{03},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{E}_{11}
	+ \dot{E}_{21}  
	+ \dot{E}_{31} 
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{02} 
	+ \dot{E}_{12}
	+ \dot{E}_{22} 
	+ \dot{E}_{32} 
	- \dot{E}_{2} 
	- \dot{Q}_{20}.
\end{equation}

The First Law around the goods and services sector (3) including, 
for now, the accumulation rate of direct energy in the sector 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{03} 
	+ \dot{E}_{13}
	+ \dot{E}_{23} 
	+ \dot{E}_{33} 
	- \dot{E}_3 
	- \dot{Q}_{30}.
\end{equation}

Similar to Example~B, we can generalize 
Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_0}--\ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_3}
with sums to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_biosphere_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{Q}_{i0} - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{E}_{0i}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=0}^n\dot{E}_{ij} 
	- \dot{E}_{j}  
	- \dot{Q}_{j0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j \in [1, n]$. 
Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_biosphere_general} and 
\ref{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general} are identical to 
Equations~\ref{eq:CV_E_biosphere_general} and 
\ref{eq:B-CV_E_econ_general}, 
indicating that we have successfully generalized 
the model to any number of sectors.

In this economy, the purpose of the goods and services sector (3) 
is to produce goods and provide services, 
it provides no direct energy to society. 
The purpose of the energy sector (2) is to make direct energy ($\dot{E}$) 
available to the economy and society in a useful form.
We may simplify the above equations
by realizing that (a)~$\dot{E}_{3} = \dot{E}_{3i} = 0$, 
because the goods and services sector 
is assumed to produce no direct energy, 
and (b) $\dot{E}_{03} = 0$, 
because the goods and services sector (3) 
receives no direct energy from the biosphere (0), 
except via the energy sector (2).
Thus, several terms in the sums of
Equation~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general}
will be zero.
