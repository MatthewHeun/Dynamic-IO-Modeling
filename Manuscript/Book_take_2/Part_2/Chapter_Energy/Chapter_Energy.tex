%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:energy_methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

In Chapter \ref{chap:intro}, we formulated a model of economies
consisting of producers and consumers who exchange
goods and services and factors of production 
while extracting resources and disposing of wastes. 
In Chapter \ref{chap:materials}, we established the material basis of economies: 
economies are analogous to organisms that process raw resources
for the benefit of producers and consumers while generating unavoidable wastes.
In this chapter, we describe and analyze the direct energy that is associated 
with the material flows.

Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content} shows a corresponding 
direct energy flow for each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}.
``Direct'' energy refers to forms of energy accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics,
including chemical potential energy, 
nuclear potential energy, 
gravitational potential energy,
thermal energy, 
and kinetic energy.
We use the term ``direct'' energy as distinct from ``embodied'' energy, 
which will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:embodied_energy}.
Examples of direct energy flows include 
the chemical potential energy of coal inflows to an energy sector, 
the thermal energy of process steam into a textile plant, and
the thermal energy of CO$_2$ automobile exhaust.
In each case, the material (coal, steam, and CO$_2$) 
carries direct energy with it.\footnote{Even radiative thermal energy 
can be considered a material flow (photons) that carries
direct energy (thermal) with it.}


\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/PERKS_basic_unit_energy_content.pdf}
\caption{Energy content ($\dot{E}$) of material flows 
($\dot{R}$, $\dot{S}$, and $\dot{K}$) 
from Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}. 
**** Mik: This figure should not have the green lines. 
The point of this figure is that the $\dot{R}$, $\dot{S}$, and $\dot{K}$ lines 
each have energy associated with them. 
We'll aggregate those lines in the next figure, 
which includes \emph{only} green lines. 
Also, the subscripts should have dots on them: 
$\dot{R}$, $\dot{S}$, etc. 
Can you add an $\dot{E}_{\dot{P}}$ label to the purple line? 
Finally, Would it be possible to put the labels 
in the same color as the lines they're labeling? --Matt ****}
\label{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
\end{figure}

For any boundary (around, say, a machine, a plant,
a sector of the economy, or the entire economy itself), 
the First Law of Thermodynamics says that
the accumulation rate of direct energy within the boundary
is equal to the sum of the signed direct energy flow rates $\left( \dot{E} \right)$
across the boundary (where inflows are positive and outflows are negative): 
energy is conserved.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_with_accumulation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum \dot{E}
\end{equation}

When there is no accumulation of direct energy within the boundary,
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \right)$ the sum of all 
signed direct energy flow rates $\left( \dot{E} \right)$ will be zero.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_no_accumulation}
	\sum \dot{E} = 0
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the direct energy associated with some material flows can
be very small or negligible compared to other direct energy flows in the economy.
For example, the direct energy of steel into the automobile sector of the economy 
is almost negligible. (The \emph{embodied} energy of the steel is almost certainly
\emph{not} negligible, as will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.)
On the other hand, the direct energy flow rates for fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas)
are typically orders of magnitude larger than any others for a given unit of analysis.

To simplify the direct energy analysis, 
we can aggregate the direct energy flows of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
into single arrows when appropriate. 
For example, the direct energy inputs from other sectors of the economy
(labeled as $\dot{E}_{\dot{R}}$, $\dot{E}_{\dot{S}}$, and $\dot{E}_{\dot{K}}$ 
in Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}) can be summed to $\dot{E}$ 
(in Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy}) such that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:direct_energy_aggregation}
	\dot{E}_{\mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy}}} 
	= \dot{E}_{\dot{R}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{S}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{K}, \: \mathrm{Fig. \: \ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Aggregated direct energy flow rates around 
the producer of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}.
**** Mik: remove the subscript ``E'' from the label in this figure. Also, change the

\label{fig:PERKS_energy}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example A: one sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Aggregated direct energy flows are now applied to Example A, 
the single-sector economy shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}.
By summing the direct energy flows associated with
each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}, we obtain
a simplified picture of direct energy flows in the economy,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/1_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption{Direct energy flow rates for Example A, the single-sector economy.}
\label{fig:A_energy}
\end{figure}

We distinguish useful direct energy inputs to a sector of the economy
($\dot{E}_{12}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}) from wasteful direct energy flows 
($\dot{Q}_{21}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}), 
because $\dot{Q}$ typically denotes thermal energy, 
and most waste energy flows are in the form of thermal
energy, i.e., waste heat. In Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}, direct energy input to the 
economy ($\dot{E}_{12}$) is shown as being extracted from the biosphere, because
the vast majority of direct energy today is derived from fossil fuel extraction.
Waste heat from the economy ($\dot{Q}_{21}$) is shown as returning 
to the biosphere.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:energy_methodology}, 
both direct energy ($\dot{E}$), and waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) 
are accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. 
Accounting for possible accumulation of direct energy in the economy, 
the First Law of Thermodynamics for Example~A indicates that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_2/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{E}_{12} - \dot{Q}_{21}.
\end{equation}

Aside from, for example, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 
we are not stockpiling oil and coal at any meaningful rate, 
i.e. we consume fossil fuels at a rate equal to the extraction rate. 
Thus, the world is not accumulating direct energy 
in the economy.\footnote{A counter-example could be made 
for nuclear fuels where ``spent'' fuel represents a large exergetic stockpile. 
However, this reserve is not (presently) economically useful.} 
(The world \emph{is}, however, 
accumulating embodied energy in the economy as we shall see 
in Chapter \ref{chap:embodied_energy}.) 
Thus, the accumulation rate for direct energy 
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ in the above equation 
can be set to zero to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_direct_energy_no_accumulation}
	0 = \dot{E}_{12} - \dot{Q}_{21}.
\end{equation}


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example B %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

For Example B, we split the energy sector (3) from 
society (2), assuming that all useful energy for society is 
supplied by the energy sector. Figure~\ref{fig:B_energy} shows aggregated
direct energy flows associated with the material flows of Figure~\ref{fig:B_materials}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Energy/images/2_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption{Direct energy flows for Example B, a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_energy}
\end{figure}

The First Law of Thermodynamics requires that both 
direct energy and waste heat be conserved around each 
sector of the economy (2 and 3) as well as around the biosphere (1).

The First Law around the economic sector (3) 
including the accumulation rate of direct energy in the sector 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{E}_{13} + \dot{E}_{33} - \dot{E}_{3} - \dot{Q}_{31}.
\end{equation}

\noindent It is notable that sector 3 consumes 
a portion of its own energy output ($\dot{E}_{33}$) 
as it produces its goods and services: it takes energy to make energy.

First Law energy accounting around the biosphere (1) and society (2) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 =  \dot{Q}_{21} + \dot{Q}_{31} - \dot{E}_{13},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 = \dot{E}_{32} - \dot{Q}_{21}.
\end{equation}

As in Example A, we can set the accumulation of direct energy 
within each sector to zero to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_3_SS}
	0 =\dot{E}_{13} + \dot{E}_{33} - \dot{E}_{3} - \dot{Q}_{31},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_1_SS}
	0 =  \dot{Q}_{21} + \dot{Q}_{31} - \dot{E}_{13},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_2_SS}
	0 =\dot{E}_{32} - \dot{Q}_{21},
\end{equation}
