In Chapters~\ref{chap:direct_energy} and~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}, 
we noted that energy is the currency of Thermodynamics,
and we developed accounting equations for flows of 
direct ($\dot{E}$) and embodied ($\dot{B}$) energy through an economy.
In this chapter, we develop a framework for accounting
value flows\index{economic value!flow of} ($\dot{X}$) through economies.
Accounting flows of value is a necessary step along
the path to developing equations (in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}) 
that describe the energy intensity of intermediate
and final products within an economy.

**** MCD---do we need some references in this section? ****

We begin by explicitly describing what we mean by value. 
For pragmatic reasons, we follow the standard, neoclassical approach of using the market price at the time of an exchange
 to determine the value of the flows of products (goods, services and capital). The data to estimate these flows is readily available in most developed countries. We note, however, that at this time, 
market values are not ascribed to flows of natural resources and wastes. Thus, a major drawback to using only market transactions is to measure the flows of value is that
important value flows that accompany natural resources and waste to and from
the biosphere are not included. However, at a future date, if values can be
associated with these flows to and from the biosphere, our framework could accomodate these easily.\footnote{As of this printing, 
the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is in its third revision 
using a process of global consultation. 
This system contains internationally agreed-upon standards that all countries will use to measure
flows to and from the biosphere. 
More information can be found at \url{http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp}.} ****define subjective theory of value ***
Section~\ref{sec:theory of value} 
contains a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the neoclassical subjective theory of value.



It is important to be clear that despite our focus on material and energy flows through an economy, 
our framework does not assume, nor does it lead to, an energy theory of value. 
Goods and services are valued based on market transactions. 



Because the basic unit of analysis in our framework is the economic sector, 
flows of value within the economy are based on the prices agreed 
upon in the transactions. 
The flows of value that accompany the material and energy flows in and out 
of one sector in an economy are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:basic_value}.

for a single sector. 
The value flows are associated with each of the different 
material and energy flows outlined in previous chapters.}
\label{fig:basic_value} 
\end{figure}

We denote creation and destruction
of value within a sector using the notion of ``source'' and ``sink.''
In Figure~\ref{fig:basic_value_aggregated}, the open circle, 
``source,'' inside the economic sector represents the value-added,
that is, the value that is created by the economic processes within that sector. 
The flows of value from a value-source are denoted $\dot{X}_{gen}$. 
Similarly, black circles represent the value ``sinks''  where value is destroyed 
by economic  processes or natural disasters. 
The flows of value into the value sinks are denoted $\dot{X}_{dest}$. 
Although we do not define 
the value creation and destruction processes any further (mathematically), 
we discuss what is meant by the
underlying processes in more detail below.

Distinction is made between value flows that

Within the sector there is destruction of value $\dot{X}_{dest}$, 
represented by the downward arrow flowing 
into the black sink and generation of value, 
represented by the arrow flowing out of a source. }

Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} shows flows of value in the single-sector economy.
Following typical assumptions in economic modeling, 
the economy is \emph{completely isolated} from the biosphere
in terms of both material inputs and wastes.
In other words, the value flows of an economy are \emph{independent from}
material inputs and wastes.
Value flows are independent from material inputs,
because raw materials have no economic value 
until they have been removed from the biosphere by the extraction industry.
Value flows are independent from wastes,
because wastes, by definition, have no economic value 
after they leave the economy.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_2/Chapter_Values/images/1_sector_value.pdf}
\caption[Flows of value for a one-sector economy]{Flows of value ($\dot{X}$) for a one-sector economy.}
\label{fig:A_value} 
\end{figure}

The contrast between Figures~\ref{fig:A_materials} and~\ref{fig:A_energy}, 
on the one hand, 
and Figure~\ref{fig:A_value}, 
on the other, is striking.  
The picture of material and energy flows in 
Figures~\ref{fig:A_materials} and~\ref{fig:A_energy} 
indicates a dependence upon the biosphere 
that is not reflected in the value flows of Figure~\ref{fig:A_value}.
The isloation of the value flows from the biosphere is a consequence
of the subjective theory of value\index{theory of value!subjective} 
that underpins modern economics.
The biosphere is akin to a third party with no voice 
in determining the value of a transaction:
it is neither buyer nor seller. 

Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1} describes the accumulation 
of value\index{economic value!accumulation}
($X$)\nomenclature[X]{$X$}{stock of economic value [\$]} in Society (1).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_X_acct_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{X}_{11} 
	- \dot{X}_{1}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen,1}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,1}.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[X]{$\dot{X}$}{economic value flow rate [\$/s]}
\nomenclature[Xgen]{$\dot{X}_{gen}$}{rate of generation of economic value [\$/s]}
\nomenclature[Xdest]{$\dot{X}_{dest}$}{rate of destruction of economic value [\$/s]}

\noindent{} The following subsections discuss the terms in Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}.


%+++++++++ Example A: Economic Transactions ++++++++++
\subsection{Economic transactions ($\dot{X}_{11}$ and $\dot{X}_{1}$)}
%+++++++++

The returning arrow in Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} 
represents transactions between 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{buyers (who receive things of value, $\dot{X}_{11}$,
	in exchange for currency) and}
	\item{sellers (who give up things of value, $\dot{X}_{1}$,
	in exchange for currency).}
\end{itemize}

It is interesting to note that when a good is sold for more
than the producer paid for its inputs, 
the seller has created value and sold it into the economy. 
As a consequence, the seller's stock of currency grows,
providing the seller with an increased level of claim 
on value in the economy.

The subjective theory of value\index{theory of value!subjective}
(Section~\ref{sec:Value_Methodology})
posits that buyers and sellers agree on value at the 
time of the transaction.
Thus, $\dot{X}_{1} = \dot{X}_{11}$, and Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}
simplifies to

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_X_acct_2}	
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}	
	= \dot{X}_{gen,1}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,1},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}indicating that value accumulates in the economy
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
due to value generation ($\dot{X}_{gen,1}$) 
and destruction ($\dot{X}_{dest,1}$) processes only.


%+++++++++ Example A: value generation ++++++++++
\subsection{Value generation ($\dot{X}_{gen}$)}
%+++++++++

\noindent In Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}, 
the value generation term ($\dot{X}_{gen}$) is akin to growing apples
in Section~\ref{sec:Materials_Methodology}: 
value is generated, seemingly out of nothing.
But, in fact, value is not created out of nothing. 
Rather, value is created from a variety of factors that have no apparent 
monetary cost to producers, including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{flow of solar energy\index{solar energy}\index{energy!solar|see{solar energy}}
	into the economy,
	as in the example of growing apples,}
	\item{extraction of resources (e.g., water\index{water}, minerals\index{minerals}, and
	fossil fuels\index{fossil fuels}) or any other unpriced goods from the biosphere,}
	\item{exploitation of the unpriced waste assimilation capacity of the biosphere,}
	\item{utilization of capital stock, labor, and energy to produce products
	that are more valuable than inputs, and}
	\item{application of human ingenuity\index{ingenuity!human} 
	and innovation\index{innovation}, 
	which lead to increasingly efficient production processes.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}The subjective theory of value indicates that 
there is no economic value associated with these ``transactions''
that generate value, because no currency is exchanged. 

The above factors indicate that the process of value generation
has both direct and indirect impacts on the biosphere.
The direct impacts are obvious: 
extraction of non-renewable resources from the biosphere, 
at rates greater than their natural accretion,
represents unsustainable overuse of natural capital.
The indirect impacts are less obvious: 
human ingenuity can lead to increased wealth,
leading to increased demand rates for goods and services, 
whose production requires ever-increasing rates 
of unsustainable natural resource extraction.

$\dot{X}_{gen}$ is accounted as ``value added'' to an industry in the BEA tables.
**** Becky: is this correct? 
Becky: look at the BEA tables' definition of ``value added'' to 
see if there is another sentence that can be added for clarification. ****


%+++++++++ Example A: value destruction ++++++++++
\subsection{Value destruction ($\dot{X}_{dest}$)}
%+++++++++

\noindent In Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}, 
the value destruction term ($\dot{X}_{dest}$)\index{economic value!destruction of} 
is akin to consuming apples: 
value is destroyed by a process that consumes, 
or otherwise renders unusable, 
previously-valuable things in the economy
(see Section~\ref{sec:Materials_Methodology}).
The factors that lead to value destruction
($\dot{X}_{dest}$) include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{depreciation\index{depreciation}, usually associated with disposal of 
	materials and equipment to the biosphere at end of life and}
	\item{natural disasters, such as hurricanes and typhoons,
	that destroy equipment and property.}
\end{itemize}

$\dot{X}_{dest}$ is accounted as **** what **** to an industry in the BEA tables.
Is it simply a negative ``value add?''
**** Becky: What do we write here? ****


%+++++++++ Example A: GDP and Stock of Value ++++++++++
\subsection{GDP and the stock of value}
%+++++++++

If Society (1) in Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} represents 
the economy of an entire country, 
$\dot{X}_{1}$ is its gross domestic product (GDP)\index{gross domestic product}
in units of \$/year.
The stock of value, $X_1$, is the total value of everything that 
is accumulated in society.

**** Becky: anything to add to the above sections? ****


%%%%%%%%%% Example B: two-sector economy %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two-sector economy} % chktex 13
%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:B_value} shows flows of value ($\dot{X}$) 
within a two-sector economy. 
Again, we note the isloation of value from the biosphere.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption[Flows of value within a two-sector economy.]{Flows of value ($\dot{X}$) within a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_value}
\end{figure}

We can account for value flows by writing
the following equations:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B-value-1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{X}_{11}
	+ \dot{X}_{21}
	- \dot{X}_{1}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen,1}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,1}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}and

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B-value-2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{X}_{12}
	+ \dot{X}_{22}
	- \dot{X}_{2}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen,2}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,2}.
\end{equation}

Equations~\ref{eq:B-value-1} and~\ref{eq:B-value-2}
can be generalized as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:B-value-generalized}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{X}_{ij}
	- \dot{X}_{j}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen,j}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,j},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $n$ is the number of sectors in the economy, and $j \in [1, n]$.


%%%%%%%%%% Example C: three-sector economy %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example C: three-sector economy} % chktex 13

Figure~\ref{fig:C_value} shows flows of value ($\dot{X}$) 
within a three-sector economy.

\caption[Flows of value within a three-sector economy.]{Flows of value ($\dot{X}$) within a three-sector economy.}
\label{fig:C_value}
\end{figure}

The equations representing flows of value in Example~C are:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C-value-generalized}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{ij}
	- \dot{X}_{j}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen,j}
	- \dot{X}_{dest,j},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $n$ is the number of sectors in the economy, and $j \in [1, n]$.
Equation~\ref{eq:C-value-generalized} is identical to Equation~\ref{eq:B-value-generalized}.
If we sum the value accounting equations for the entire economy, 
we obtain

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C-value-economy-a}
	\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{ij}
	- \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{j}
	+ \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{gen,j}
	- \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{dest,j}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}With the identities

\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_identity_1}
	\dot{X}_{j}  
	= \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \dot{X}_{jk}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_identity_2}
	\sum\limits_{j=1}^n\dot{X}_{j}  
	= \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \dot{X}_{jk}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \dot{X}_{ik}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \dot{X}_{ij}
	= \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{X}_{ij},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Equation~\ref{eq:C-value-economy-a} becomes

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C-value-economy-b}
	\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{gen,j}
	- \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{dest,j},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}for $j \in [1, n]$, indicating that 
value generation ($\dot{X}_{gen,j}$) 
and destruction ($\dot{X}_{dest,j}$)
are the only mechanisms by which value is accumulated or lost
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
within the economy.


%%%%%%%%%% Value: Auto industry example %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Value in the auto industry}
\label{sec:value_auto}
%%%%%%%%%%
The theoretical model of energy and resource flows through an economy can be empirically estimated using US data available 
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), published in their \emph{Survey of Current Business} journal. **** Need citation here. ****
 The two main tables of data needed to estimate dynamic value flows and capital accumulation within the economy 
are the Input-Output accounts (IO) and the Capital Flow Table (CFT). 
 The IO table tracks commodities that are made in one industry and then used in another as intermediate inputs. [put rdot and sdot if appropriate. If transactions include capital flows, then also include kdot.]
The “making” industries related to extraction, refining, and utilities 
mark the entry point for materials extracted from the biosphere into the economy. 
 These three industries (extraction, refining, and utilities) are the first three industries listed in the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)
 that the BEA uses to track economic information. 
****BRH  add cite (Lawson and et al. 2002, 25). **** 

Using these data, Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_value_auto_ind} provides estimates 
of value flows for the US auto industry.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig:PERKS_value_auto_ind}
\end{figure}

The value of capital investment, “K” in the model is measured  by the ``Capital Flow Table.'' 
This maps the outputs of construction and certain manufacturing industries to all other industries.
****BRH add cite (Bonds and Aylor 1998)****  The ``waste output to the environment''
can be approximated by the value of the commodities that are ``made'' in all industries 
and ``used'' by the ``Waste Management Sector'' (NAICS 56). 
[put \$0 instead of 441---there is a lot, but not all, of waste that 
is routed through the waste industry on its way to the biosphere.]
Using the automotive industry as an example, the KLEM **** define BRH ****S, Input-Output, 
and Capital Flow data could be used to estimate the model as demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:data}.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{chap:auto_value_flows} for detailed calculations.}

Thus, in contrast to the lack of data for material and energy resource flows through the economy, \emph{dollar values} of material and energy resource flows through the economy are publicly available from the BEA website.
