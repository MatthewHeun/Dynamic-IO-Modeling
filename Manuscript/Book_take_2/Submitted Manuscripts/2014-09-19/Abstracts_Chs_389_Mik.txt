David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.

Chapter 8:

In this chapter, we discuss several implications that arise 
from the detailed development of our dynamic framework for material, energy, and value accounting. 
The first implications are for the energy I-O method itself. 
We recommend a physical accounting framework that fully accounts 
for capital stock and energy input from society (final consumption) to the economy. 
We then discuss implications for economic ``development,'' 
namely that economic growth could be considered a ``fully coupled'' problem: 
understanding it requires breadth of knowledge and appreciation 
for interactions among many important and complementary factors, 
including financial capital, physical capital and associated ambodied energy, 
direct energy, resources, and societal inputs. 
Each, alone, is necessary, but not sufficient, for economic development. 
We discuss implications for recycling and reuse of materials 
as well as the concept of dematerialziation. 
Finally, we view the concept of a steady-state economy 
through the lens of our framework. 
We find that there are many potential definitions of a steady-state economy, 
none of which are fully satisfying when compared against the ideal of sustainability. 



Chapter 9:

This chapter briefly summarizes the book and highlights 
the need for additional data on both inter-sector flows and accumulation 
of manufactured capital and associated embodied energy. 
We continue with a call to action, a list containing several tasks 
that should be undertaken to modify national accounting. 
Finally, we note that moving forward on these issues will be politically difficult, 
but necessary, to adapt to the age of resource depletion.
