David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.

Chapter 2:

Economic policies are based on assumptions
about how the economy functions. When those models are incorrect,
economic policies can result in unforeseen negative
consequences. In this chapter, we argue that 
current mainstream economic models, which typically exclude the biosphere,
need to be updated. Vital physical transactions
between the economy and the biosphere, such as waste
pollution, natural resource extraction, and 
use of ecosystem services, are not captured
in current models of the economy. Because these 
models also determine what data are needed to 
develop appropriate policy, 
national accounts are incomplete as well.
In this chapter, we describe explain how economic models
can be informed by the metaphors for how
the economy works.

the development of approaches 
to the relationship between the economy and the biosphere. 
The historical development takes place over three eras, 
the era of abundance, the era of energy constraints, 
and the age of resource depletion. 
Each era is defined by a dominant metaphor that guides 
the economic model and leads to a framework for national accounting 
that is perceived as relevant to understanding the economy. 
The metaphor for the economy has evolved from the clockwork mechanism 
of classical physics (economy isolated from the environment) 
to an engine (the economy is dependent on an inexhaustible supply of inputs from the environment). 
The chapter then suggests that the previous metaphors are insufficient 
for the age of resource depletion and suggests a new metaphor: 
the economy is society's \emph{metabolism}. 
Next, the way in which the metabolism metaphor leads 
to an expanded understanding of the requirements for national accounting 
is described. 
An argument is made for accounting a nation's wealth 
(manufactured and natural capital) in addition to its income (GDP). 
The chapter ends with a description of the structure of the rest of the book. 





Chapter 6:

In this chapter, we develop techniques to account 
for flows of economic value through economies. 
We employ the prevailing subjective theory of value for our framework, 
that is, we use the value of market transactions 
to value physical flows of materials and energy. 
As part of the methodology section, we discuss the limitations 
to relying solely on valuations obtainable from market transactions 
and call for additional non-market valuation methods to be employed in national accounting. 
In particular, we point to the System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA), 
the international standard developed by the UN\@. 
We then develop value accounting equations and apply them to example economies~A--C.
This chapter introduces two new terms to capture value-added (and destroyed) 
within economic sectors, and demonstrate that these terms capture the value for GDP in national accounts. 
Finally, we illustrate how our framework can be populated with data 
from current national accounts to derive inter-sectoral value flows, 
using national accounting data for the auto industry for illustration. 
This section of the chapter also contains a discussion of the potential problems 
with including intangible intellectual property assets in the nations measure of its capital stock.
