David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.

Chapter 3:

The first step in understanding the economic metabolism 
is to account the flow of materials through the economy 
and the exchange of materials with the biosphere.
In this chapter, we develop a framework 
for accounting material flows and accumulation
within economies.
We begin by considering accounting in everyday life
and continue with concepts from thermodynamics, 
such as system boundaries, control volumes, and
the First Law of Thermodynamics,
to develop a rigorous accounting framework.
This framework is applied first to a one-sector then 
two-sector model of the economy
as we construct a general framework for material
accounting.
We then apply the framework to the real-world
example of the US auto industry.



Chapter 8:

The metabolism metaphor and the material, energy, and economic value accounting framework 
presented in the book has a number of implications for 
the manner in which we understand our economies.
In this chapter, we discuss several of these implications. 
The first set of implications is for the energy I-O method itself. 
We recommend a physical accounting framework that fully accounts 
for capital stock and energy input from society (final consumption) to the economy. 
We then discuss implications for economic ``development,'' 
namely that economic growth could be considered a ``fully coupled'' problem: 
understanding it requires breadth of knowledge and appreciation 
for interactions among many important and complementary factors, 
including financial capital, manufactured capital and associated embodied energy, 
natural capital, direct energy, and societal inputs. 
Each, alone, is necessary, but not sufficient, for economic development. 
We discuss implications for recycling and reuse of materials 
and for the concept of dematerialization. 
Finally, we view the concept of a steady-state economy 
through the lens of our framework. 
We find that there are many potential definitions of a steady-state economy, 
none of which are fully satisfying when compared against the ideal of sustainability. 



Chapter 9:

The dynamic accounting framework presented in previous chapters
naturally gives rise to a set next steps necessary
to expand systems of national accounts 
to encompass material and energy flows within our economies 
and exchanges with the biosphere.
This final chapter briefly summarizes the book and highlights 
the need for additional data on both inter-sector flows and accumulation 
of manufactured capital and its embodied energy. 
We continue with a call to action, 
a list of several tasks that should be undertaken to modify national accounting. 
Finally, we note that moving forward on these issues will be politically difficult, 
but necessary, to adapt to the age of resource depletion.
