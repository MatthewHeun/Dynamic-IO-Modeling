David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.

Chapter 2:

Economic policies are based on simplified models
about how an economy functions. When those models are not 
correct,
economic policies based on them can result in unexpected negative
economic outcomes, as shown in the previous chapter. In this chapter, we argue that 
current mainstream economic models, which typically exclude the biosphere,
are too narrow in scope. Vital physical transactions
between the economy and the biosphere, such as waste
pollution, natural resource extraction, and 
use of ecosystem services, are not captured. We suggest
that the reason for this is that current
economic models are based
on an incorrect metaphor for the economy. We describe 
three eras of thinking about the economy,
its relationship to the biosphere, and the
metaphors that emerged during those times. We argue
that as the world enters the age
of resource depletion, 
it is time for a new metaphor. We join with several
others in arguing for a metaphor that presumes that society 
is more similar to a living organism tightly coupled
to the biosphere, than to a mechanical engine that the biosphere 
provides for as needed. 
We then suggest that if society 
resembles a living organism, 
the economy represents society's \emph{metabolism}. 
We describe the metabolic processes 
of anabolism, catabolism, and autophagy and draw analogies from them
to key elements of economic processes: capital
formation, energy production, and recycling. Currently, 
economic policies are unable
to address such issues as appropriate 
levels and types of capital formation, 
efficient energy production, and wise use of recycling, in the context of the 
appropriate scale
in relation to the biosphere. Currently, national accounting
counts these and other types of beneficial activities against the measure
of economic growth, because national accounts  
only produce measures of economic output
(national income). These 
beneficial activities would likely reduce economic
output, but they would benefit the economy by
increasing its
\emph{natural capital}.
We conclude that current economic policies
require expanded national accounting that captures
robust, annual data on the entire portfolio of a nation's wealth 
(manufactured and natural capital) and not simply
data on national income (GDP). 
The chapter ends with a description of the structure of the rest of the book. 





Chapter 6:

Accounting for the flow of value through an economy, also know as
value-added, is currently the primary mission of national accounts. 
The sum of value-added across all industry sectors is a nation's
income, or GDP.
The US Bureau of Econonmic Analysis and most other national
accounting agencies produce a wide
array of annual data tables
on the components of national income and the inter-sectoral
flows, know as Input-Output accounts. In this chapter, 
we use these same techniques to account 
for flows of economic value through economies. We argue that 
accounting
value flows is more complicated than accounting physical flows
because it requires philosophical justification for the 
how value is ascribed. 
National accounting agencies employ a \emph{subjective} theory of value,
as do we in our framework. That is, the value 
of the flow of physical materials and energy
is assumed to be the negotiated price 
used in the exchange of currency for the materials or energy. 
In this chapter, however, we also discuss the limitations 
to relying solely on market transactions to value economic flows.
Valuable exchanges between the economy and the biosphere
take place outside the market, and thus are not integrated into
national accounts. 
We point to the expanded UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA)
or the US Integrated Enviornmental Economic System of Accounts (IEESA) as the way forward.
We then introduce the terms needed in our framework to capture value-added (and destroyed) 
and develop value accounting equations. We apply them to example economies~A--C,
as in previous chapters,
and illustrate how our framework works with extant
national accounts by
populating it with national accounting data for the auto industry.
The chapter uses the auto industry example to raise a concern about data
missing from national accounts and
the effects of recent changes to national accounts that 
have begun to account more and more intangible assets, such as
software and intellectual property, in the nations measure of its capital stock.
