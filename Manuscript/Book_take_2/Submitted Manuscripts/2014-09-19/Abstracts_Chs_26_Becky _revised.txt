David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.

Chapter 2:


Mainstream economic models, 
which typically exclude physical transactions
between the economy and the biosphere, 
are incomplete: 
wastes, pollution, natural resource extraction, and 
use of ecosystem services are not included. 
When economic policy is informed by these incomplete models,
unexpected negative outcomes can arise.
In this chapter, we suggest
that the reason for the incompleteness of mainstream economic models is 
that we incorrectly understand the economy 
through an outdated metaphor: the economy is a machine.
We describe three eras of thinking about the economy,
its relationship to the biosphere, and the
metaphors that emerged during each era. 
We argue that as the world enters the age
of resource depletion, it is time for a new metaphor:
the economy is society's \emph{metabolism}.
We describe the metabolic processes 
of anabolism, catabolism, and autophagy 
and draw analogies
to key economic processes: 
capital formation, energy production, and recycling. 
Based on the machine metaphor, today's economic policies are unable
to address important issues such as appropriate levels and types of capital formation, 
efficient energy production, wise use of recycling, and 
the appropriate scale of the economy relative to the biosphere. 
The problem is compounded by today's national accounting,
which fails to count many beneficial activities in GDP, 
simply because because GDP measures only what is produced. 
Thus, wise and beneficial long-term decisions that would that preserve or enhance
natural capital (such as refraining from clearcutting forests)
might, ultimately, reduce GDP.
We conclude that navigating through the age of resource depletion
will require expanded national accounting that captures
robust, annual data on the entire portfolio of a nation's wealth 
(manufactured and natural capital) in addition to 
data on national income (GDP).
The chapter ends with a description of the structure of the rest of the book. 




Chapter 6:

To quantify financial activites and interdependencies within an economy,
economists account for flows of economic value among sectors of the economy. 
In this chapter, we utilize the prevailing subjective theory of value
to develop a framework for value accounting that is consistent with the 
materials, energy, and embodied energy accounting frameworks
presented in prior chapters.
We note that important and essential material exchanges between the economy and the biosphere
(including energy extraction from the biosphere and waste assimilation by the biosphere)
take place outside of the market, and, as such, they are not included in
national accounts and have no economic value.
We point to the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA)
or the US Integrated Enviornmental Economic System of Accounts (IEESA) as the way forward
to including some of these essential extra-market transactions in national accounting.
Similar to previous chapters, 
a series of increasingly-disaggregated model economies is used
to develop our value accounting framework.
Value flows for the US auto industry are presented,
and concerns are raised about recent changes to include intangible assets,
such as software and intellectual property, as capital stock.
