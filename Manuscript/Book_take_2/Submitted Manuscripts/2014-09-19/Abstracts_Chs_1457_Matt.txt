David's instructions:

Regarding the abstracts, please see a few modifications to the Chapter 1 abstract attached. 
It is usually better to begin with a direct statement 
of the subject or proposition rather than a phrase such as "In this chapter,..." 
You may not like how I used "The guiding premise of this book...", 
but perhaps you can instead say that evidence is presented that suggests, supports the premise, etc. 

If you agree with at least the first change, 
please start all of the abstracts with a direct proposition 
and some form of conclusion as presented in the chapter at the end of the abstract. 
Going back to "The guiding premise of this book," 
I was a little uncomfortable with a statement 
that seemed to take as an assumption something 
that at least some readers will have to be convinced is true. 
I think you have to say something in the abstract 
about where and how the book supports this premise.


==============================================


Chapter 1:

We are entering a new era in which 
biophysical limits related to natural resource extraction rates and
the biosphere's waste assimilation capacity
are becoming binding constraints on mature economies.
Unfortunately, the data needed for policy-makers to understand and manage 
economic growth in the new era are not universally available. 
In this chapter, we discuss the problems that arise from relying solely 
on the Solow growth model to describe an economy that is,
in reality, deeply interconnected with the biosphere. 
We point out that mainstream economists forecast low growth rates 
for mature economies for the foreseeable future, 
because traditional drivers of economic growth 
(growth rates of capital and labor productivity) have plateaued. 
Unfortunately, mainstream policy recommendations to reinvigorate growth,
based on the Solow growth model, 
ignore three critical realities:
the economy is tightly coupled to the biosphere, 
there exist real and binding physical and technological limits 
to the rate at which materials and energy can be extracted from the biosphere, and
today’s emplacement of manufactured capital locks in tomorrow’s 
material and energy demands from the biosphere.
As such, mainstream policy recommendations are likely to fail in the long run:
today's expansion of the stock of capital in the economy 
in the hopes of enhancing consumption can contribute to the 
slowdown of economic growth by bringing us ever-closer to biophysical limits.
The chapter ends by noting that we need a new way to understand our economy, 
and we suggest that 
detailed information about materials, energy, embodied energy, and energy intensity 
be routinely gathered and analyzed and disseminated from a centralized location
to provide markets and policymakers a more-comprehensive understanding 
of the biophysical economy.
However, a firm theoretical underpinning is needed before proceeding
along this new path, 
and the remainder of this book provides a rigorous theoretical framework 
for a better system of national accounts, one that goes beyond GDP 
and one that is relevant to the age of resource depletion.



Chapter 4:

Accounting for direct energy as it flows through an economy is essential 
for developing a dynamic picture of its metabolism.
In this chapter, we apply the First Law of Thermodynamics
to sectors of the economy to describe flows of direct energy
from the biosphere, through economies, and ultimately back to the biosphere as waste heat. 
Direct energy accounting equations are developed through a series 
of example economies with increasing levels of disaggregation. 
Finally, direct energy flows for the example of the US auto industry are discussed. 




Chapter 5: 

In addition to materials and direct energy, embodied energy is essential to understand 
how the biophysical economy operates, because it provdes an indication of the 
distribution of intra-economy energy demand created by consumption of goods and services.
Furthermore, the energy embodied in manufactured capital
provides, to first approximation, an estimate of the energy required to replace
depreciated capital.
This chapter begins by developing, for the first time in the literature,
a rigorous, theormodynamically-based definition of embodied energy.
We then show that energy embodied in the products of an economic sector 
is the sum of all direct energy 
consumed along the supply chain, 
including all upstream processing stages.
We note that waste heat from a sector is additive to the energy 
embodied within products of a sector, 
thereby providing the mechanism for accumulating 
embodied energy along the manufacturing supply chain. 
Equations that describe 
the accumulation and flow of embodied energy through economies are developed
through a series of increasingly-disaggregated model economies. 
Finally, we discuss embodied energy in the context of our running example, 
the US auto industry. 
We find that there are very few estimates in the literature
of energy embodied within automobiles.



Chapter 7:

Energy intensity, 
the ratio of total energy consumed during the manufacture of a product
to the economic value of that product expressed in units of J/\$, 
is an inherently useful metric that describes the accumulation 
of energy consumption and economic value along
the pathways traveled by products through an economy.
It is a key piece of information that can help consumers and firms alike 
make wise consumption and investment decisions in the age of resource depletion.
Unfortunately, energy intensity is not routinely estimated, and, if it is, 
it erroneously does not account for the energy embodied 
in our accumulating stock of manufactured capital.
The Energy Input-Output (EI-O) method, developed by
Bullard, Herendeen, and others as an extension to Leontief's groundbreaking work,
has been used historically to develop 
static estimates of the energy intensity of products within economy.
In this chapter, we extend the EI-O method 
to develop a mathematical technique to estimate 
energy intensity in a dynamic economy, 
one that can accumulate manufactured capital in its sectors.
As in previous chapters, 
the equations are developed by example in increasingly-disaggregated economies.
We review several studies of energy intensity of the US auto industry in the literature 
and note a wide range of results from one study to the next.
The estimates of energy intensity also vary with time. 
The range of energy intensities for the auto sector 
is $0.83 \times 10^{4}$ kJ/\$ to $11.6 \times 10^{4}$ kJ/\$.
