Heun, Dale, and Haney present a powerful and insightful overview 
of our economic system 
and how GDP is connected to biological and physical systems 
at the extractive interface (agriculture and mining sectors).  
It begins with a rigorous analytical framework 
that tracks the flows of materials, energy, and embodied energy 
to characterize the ``footprints'' we leave on the planet 
as our lifestyles ``consume'' the various components of GDP.  
The book's major contribution is to show how 
the incomplete national accounting data 
systematically underestimates the impact of these footprints, 
especially during rapid energy infrastructure transitions 
like the one currently underway.
With incomplete data we do the wrong things!
For academics, policymakers, and students alike, 
the book provides a fresh perspective and constructive proposals 
based on a solid analytical foundation.

BONEPILE:

There’s a huge gap between the reality 
of today's mines-to-landfills economic system 
and the utopian vision of living sustainably 
on an earth where all materials are recycled 
using renewable energy from the sun.  
Since the 1970s, the economy has lurched 
from collisions with one 
biological or physical constraint after another.  
The earth is striking back.  
[It’s clear that] a big part of the problem 
is the public policies that aim to maximize GDP--an imperfect measure 
of economic well-being and an incomplete measure 
of societal welfare--with little regard for biophysical limits.  
But our national accounting system that purports 
to measure economic progress 
fails to include the data needed 
to explore the root causes of the crises that torment us.  
When we use the wrong metric we do the wrong things.  


OPTION A   

Heun, Dale, and Haney present a powerful and insightful overview 
of our economic system 
and how GDP is connected to biological and physical systems 
at the extractive interface (agriculture and mining sectors).  
It begins with a rigorous analytical framework 
that tracks the flows of materials, energy, and embodied energy 
to characterize the ``footprints'' we leave on the planet 
as our lifestyles ``consume'' the various components of GDP.  
The book's major contributions are to show 
how these footprints are underestimated 
by the data in the national economic accounting system, 
especially during major energy infrastructure transitions 
like the one currently underway.   
For academics, policymakers, and students alike, 
the book provides a fresh perspective and constructive proposals 
based on a solid analytical foundation.   

OPTION B  

Heun, Dale, and Haney present a rigorous analytical framework 
that connects our lifestyles 
(the goods and services comprising GDP) 
to the ``footprints'' we leave on the earth's 
biological and physical systems 
at the extractive interface 
(the agricultural and mining industries).    
The book’s major contributions show how 
the incomplete data in our national economic accounting system 
systematically underestimates the impact of these footprints, 
especially during rapid energy infrastructure transitions 
like the one currently underway.   
For academics, policymakers, and students alike, 
the book provides a fresh perspective and constructive proposals 
based on a solid analytical foundation.
