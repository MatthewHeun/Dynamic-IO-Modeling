% We want the Introduction to be numbered as Chapter 1.

% Another note: simply resetting the chapter counter to 0
% after the frontmatter caused hyperlinks within the book
% to be mixed up.
% For example, clicking on "1 Introduction" in the outline
% brought you to the Preface.
% Setting the chapter counter to -3 here solves that problem!
