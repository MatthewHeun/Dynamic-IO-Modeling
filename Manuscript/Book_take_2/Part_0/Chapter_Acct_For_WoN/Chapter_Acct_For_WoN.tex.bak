Why is society doing the accounting incorrectly? 
Because we do not have correct assumptions about the way the economy works.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:incomplete_accounting}, 
national accounting is incomplete, and
an objective for this book is to provide rigorous theoretical grounding for 
a better national accounting framework.

**** The motivation for this comes from looking at the history
of how society has determined what should be incuded in national accounts. 
Change the 

The need for this is obvious when we look the vision society has for national accounts.
****

But, before moving ahead with developing that framework,
it is useful to consider how society has come to this point.
How is it that we don't routinely and comprehensively account for
important material and energy flows into, within, and out of the economy
on a physical basis in systems of national accounts?

The classical economists certainly appreciated the dependence of
economic activity on biophysical processes.\cite{Hall2011, Cleveland1987, Dale2012}
However, somewhere between William Stanley Jevons' 1865
assessment that
``the very existence of Britain, as a great nation''~\cite[IV.3]{Jevons1865}
was tied to a continued supply of low-cost coal 
and Julian Simon's 1998 statement that
``natural resources are not finite in any economic sense,''~\cite[p.~54]{Simon1998} %chktex 38
the importance of the biosphere was lost.
In the following sections, we argue that
a contributing reason for incomplete national accounting
is that we have the wrong metaphor for the economy,
and we provide a suggestion for improvement.


%+++++++++ The clockwork metaphor ++++++++++
\subsection{The clockwork metaphor}
\label{sec:clockwork_metaphor}
%+++++++++

Most economics textbooks today depict the economy 
as in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}.
Goods and services flow from the production sector
to the household sector~(consumption)
in exchange for payments.
The factors of production (labor and capital)
flow from the household sector to the
production sector in exchange for wages and rents (income).
Attention is primarily focused on the circular flow
of money~(dashed line).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_1.pdf}
\caption[The traditional model]{In the traditional model, the economy 
is represented as a circular flow of goods and services between two sectors. 
Producers manufacture goods and services 
by taking in labor and capital. 
Consumers exchange labor for wages 
which are used to purchase 
the goods and services of the producers.}
\label{fig:perp_motion_1}
\end{figure}

This traditional model of the economy~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}) 
is unashamedly mechanistic.
General equilibrium models of the economy
~\cite{Walras1892, Walras1993}
were borrowed directly from classical physics' models of 
mechanical equilibrium which, in turn, arose from the 
``clockwork universe'' metaphor.\cite{Ingrao1990}
The clockwork metaphor is a simplification 
that helps us make sense of the world around us.
Like all metaphors, it informs our thinking about the real world,
but, consequently,
it also constrains our ability to frame reality.
Erroneously, we mistake the model-metaphor for reality, and
we interact with reality in the same manner 
as we interact with the abstract objects of our
models.\footnote{This fallacious process is known as
	\emph{reification}; the making (\emph{facere}, Latin) real of
	something (\emph{res}, Latin) that is merely an idea.
	Alfred Whitehead refers to this as
	\emph{the fallacy of misplaced concreteness}.\cite{Whitehead2011}
	}
Classical physics told us the universe was
\emph{like} clockwork, 
so we began to interact with the universe
as if it \emph{really were} clockwork.
It then became easy to collect economic data that confirmed the clockwork model,
because the model told us which data to collect.

The clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy
preclude any sort of connection 
between the economy and the biosphere.
Thus, only the internal dynamics of the economy are important. 
They tell us that natural resources are unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere will always provide.
If a particular resource becomes scarce, 
substitution to a different, more-readily-available resource will be made.
Wastes are quantitatively unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere has infinite assimilative capacity.
Economic forces (through prices and the market mechanism) 
are thought to effectively guide any necessary transition
within the economy.
With the clockwork metaphor, physical constraints 
imposed by the biosphere 
on allocation of resources, distribution of outputs, and 
scale of an economy 
are outside the scope of neoclassical economic discussion.\cite{Daly1995}
In short, the clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy 
tell us that the clockwork-economy can and will carry on.

In light of the discussion in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro},
the clockwork metaphor and traditional model of the economy
are clearly problematic.
Because Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} has no flow of energy
into the economy,
we may consider the traditional model of the economy 
to be a perpetual motion machine of the \emph{first kind}:
the economy works without the input of energy, thus violating
the First Law of Thermodynamics---the 
law of conservation of energy.\cite{Rao2004}


%%%%%%%%%% Machine metaphor %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The machine metaphor}
\label{sec:machine_metaphor}
%%%%%%%%%% 

The limits of the clockwork metaphor and traditional model of the economy were 
exposed by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
The global economy
``stalled'' due to lack of 
a single, highly-constrained resource:
fuel.
Many came to realize that input energy is required
for successful operation of an economic ``engine.''
Thus, a machine metaphor and 
accompanying engine model for the economy 
rose to prominence
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The need to include energy resources
in the economic picture
spurred the efforts of early (net) energy 
analysts.\cite{Gilliland1975, Chapman1976}

The engine model (Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}) 
accounts for energy flows from the biosphere 
to the economy.
With the new metaphor, the economy changed from 
an \emph{isolated} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}) to 
a \emph{closed} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}). 
The importance of input energy was acknowledged, 
but wastes are missing.
And, the biosphere is relegated to the position
of provider of energy resources;
the larder and gas station of the economy.\cite{Norgaard2010}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_2.pdf}
\caption[The machine model]{The machine model of the economy includes
flows of energy into the economy from the biosphere.
This may be considered a perpetual motion machine 
of the second kind.}
\label{fig:perp_motion_2}
\end{figure}

The machine metaphor and engine model,
like the clockwork metaphor and traditional model,
are mechanistic.
Much like the engines of the Industrial Revolution,
the economic engine is assumed to be well-behaved and amenable to control.
Even today, machine metaphors abound in our economic discussions.
We continue to speak of ``fueling'' the ``economic engine'' 
lest it should ``stall.''~\cite{Liu2012}
Like a well-running engine, the economy is assumed 
to be resilient to small or even quite large perturbations.  
It can either self-correct, 
or be corrected predictably with adjustments to
a few policy levers.

But how accurate is the engine model?

According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
all real-world processes involve the degradation
of material and, especially, energy resources
and the creation of entropy.  
High quality (low entropy) material and energy come in;
low quality (high entropy) material and energy go out.
Wastes exist!
The depiction of the economy in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2} 
can be classified as a perpetual motion machine
of the \emph{second kind}:
it perfectly converts energy resources into 
work~(useful energy services) without generating
any entropy,
in violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Because the generation of high entropy~(low quality)
output is a \emph{necessary} feature of \emph{all} processes 
(including economic processes),
the generation of wastes is a \emph{normal} feature of
the economy,
not an anomaly.

None of the clockwork metaphor, the traditional model, 
the machine metaphor, or the engine model 
is sufficient to describe a real economy.

We need a different model.

We need a new metaphor.


%%%%%%%%%% Economy is society's metabolism %%%%%%%%%%
\section{[MKH] The economy is society's metabolism}
\label{sec:economy_metabolism}
%%%%%%%%%%

In our opinion, an apt metaphor for the economy should provide for robust interaction
and suggest tight coupling between the biosphere and the economy. 
Specifically, it should account for the following facts about real economies. 
Economies:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\label{itm:intake}intake material and energy from the biosphere}
	\item{\label{itm:internal_exchange}exchange materials, energy, and information internally}
	\item{\label{itm:discharge}discharge material and energy wastes to the biosphere}
	\item{\label{itm:energetic_costs}are affected by energetic costs}
	\item{\label{itm:scarcity}are affected non-linearly by scarcity 
			in the face of low substitutibility}
	\item{\label{itm:non-linear}can change non-linearly or in discrete steps with the potential 
			for structural transformation}
	\item{\label{itm:embodies}accumulate embodied energy in material stocks, and}
	\item{\label{itm:robust}maintain organizational structure despite changes 
			in their environment.%
				\footnote{We note that 
				several areas of the literature speak to the items in this list.
				Materials Flow Analysis~(MFA) and 
				Economy-Wide Materials Flow Analys~(EW-MFA)
				stress the importance of
				material intake by the economy. 
				(See Section~\ref{sec:materials_auto}.)
				The Input-Output~(I-O) method highlights the effects of internal exchanges
				of material and information with economies. 
				(See Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.)
				Life-Cycle Assessment~(LCA) techniques focus attention 
				on otherwise-neglected wastes. 
				(See Section~\ref{sec:intensity_auto}.)
				Net Energy Analysis~(NEA) predicts that energy resource 
				scarcity reduces Energy Return on Investment~(EROI)
				and increases energy prices.
				(See Sections~\ref{sec:B_energy} 
				and~\ref{sec:resource_quality_and_irreversibility}.)
				The Energy Input-Output~(EI-O) method gives prominence to energetic costs
				of internal material and energy flows.
				(See Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.)
				And, thermodynamic control-volume modeling describes
				transient behavior and system transformations.
				(See Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value}.)

\end{enumerate}

Living metabolisms%
	\footnote{The 
	Greek root of metabolism 
	(\emph{metabol$\bar{e}$}) means ``change.''}
exhibit the characteristics in the list above.
Metabolisms and the organisms they support
are intimately connected with the biosphere:
they withdraw materials and energy from the biosphere~(\ref{itm:intake}), 
transfer materials and energy internally via metabolic processes~(\ref{itm:internal_exchange}),
and discharge wastes back to the biosphere~(\ref{itm:discharge});
in fact, their very survival depends on these processes.
Extending Figures~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} and~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}
to include the facts in items~(\ref{itm:intake})--(\ref{itm:discharge}), % chktex 36
we obtain Figure~\ref{fig:metabolic_economy}.
Metabolisms are affected by energetic costs~(\ref{itm:energetic_costs}): 
an organism that obtains less energy than it expends is doomed.
Withholding life-sustaining resources brings drastic, non-linear
consequences for any metabolism~(\ref{itm:scarcity}).
Metabolisms enable non-linear, structural transformations
in their host organisms (e.g., metamorphosis, puberty, and evolution)~(\ref{itm:non-linear}).
And, energy absorbed by a metabolism is considered to be ``embodied''
in the cells of the organism~(\ref{itm:embodies}).
Metabolisms exist in a state of dynamic stability~(\ref{itm:robust}),
adjusting and readjusting to maintain their internal conditions
despite changes in the environment;
for a metabolism, equilibrium means death!

The economy is society's metabolism.

of the economy, fully consistent with the laws of thermodynamics,

\label{fig:metabolic_economy}
\end{figure}

Although we're not the first to suggest the metabolism metaphor for the economy
\cite{Liu2012, Giampietro2000, Giampietro2013, F-K1999, F-K2003, Heijman:1988aa},
**** Mik--add Gowdy references? ****
we believe that
the metabolism metaphor is under-utilized 
on both practical and theoretical levels.
On the practical level, the metabolism metaphor is under-utilized
because national accounting, to date, 
is built upon the machine metaphor and engine model for the economy
(Section~\ref{sec:machine_metaphor}).
This book attempts to correct that oversight 
by using the metabolism metaphor 
to develop a rigorous theoretical framework 
for comprehensive national accounting.
(See Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:intensity}.)
On a theoretical level, the metabolism metaphor is under-utilized because 
most researchers (with the exception of Giampietro~\cite{Giampietro2000, Giampietro2013})
use the metabolism metaphor merely as as framing device for analyses of
raw material flows into the economy for the purpose of understanding 
stocks of raw materials in the biosphere.%
	\footnote{The field most closely associated with the metabolism metaphor is
	Materials Flow Analysis (MFA). 
	To be fair, materials flow analysts clearly acknowledge that 
	materials flow into the economy (minerals and ores, especially),
	in part,
	for the purpose of building up stocks of technical infrastructure (buildings),
	livestock, and people.\cite[p.~116]{F-K1999} 
	However, there is little emphasis on quantifying \emph{levels} 
	of material stock in Materials \emph{Flow} Analysis, 
	as its name implies.
	In fact, the equations in MFA~\cite[Equation~1]{F-K1999} are almost always written as%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{inflow} = \mathrm{outflow} + \mathrm{accumulation \; ,}
	\end{equation*}
	reflecting the focus on material inflow to the economy.
	In this book, similar equations 
	(see Equation~\ref{eq:general_accumulation_equation}) 
	are written as%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{accumulation} = \mathrm{inflow} - \mathrm{outflow \; ,}
	\end{equation*}
	thereby focusing on accumulation of stocks within the economy.
	}
Those who employ the metabolism metaphor
tend to focus little attention on capital stock within the economy itself.
In effect, this is the same oversight as national accounting: 
under-appreciation of the important role of capital
in determining material and energy demand 
for the emplacement, use, maintenance, and replacement of the very same capital.

It becomes a vicious cycle. 
By not accounting for capital stock on a physical basis 
in national accounting (see Section~\ref{sec:incomplete_accounting}), 
society is unable to appreciate 
the important physical role that capital stock plays in the economy
(see Section~\ref{sec:stall_capital_stock}).
Because society under-appreciates the physical role of capital stock in the economy, 
there is little urgency to begin accounting 
for manufactured capital on a physical (rather than financial) basis.

We think that a deeper understanding of the metabolic metaphor
can serve to both highlight the important physical role of manufactured capital stock and 
provide the basis for a rigorous theoretical framework 
for comprehensive national accounting.
In the following sections, 
we deepen the metabolism metaphor by considering 
anabolism (capital formation),
catabolism (energy production),
autophagy (recycling), and
issues of scale.
Thereafter, we summarize the benefits of the metabolism metaphor
for national accounting.

%+++++++++ Anabolism ++++++++++
\subsection{Anabolism (capital formation)}
\label{sec:anabolism}
%+++++++++

Metabolic processes are classified as anabolic and catabolic 
(Section~\ref{sec:catabolism}).
Anabolic processes build up materials within the body (bones, muscles, tissues).
For example, anabolic steroids are hormones that stimulate 
the human body's natural muscle and bone growth processes.
Anabolic processes are fueled by the breakdown 
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cellular energy source.
Raw materials for anabolic processes are provided by food, 
which, ultimately, comes from the biosphere.

The economic analog to biological anabolism is capital formation, 
net addition to the stock of capital within a period of time.
Traditionally, capital formation is measured in currency units.
Thus, capital formation is the financial evidence 
of the emplacement of manufactured infrastructure.
Whereas biological anabolism is fueled by ATP, 
capital formation is fueled by the energy sector of the economy.
The raw material for capital formation comes to the 
economy from the biosphere.

We discuss extraction and use of materials in Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}
and the importance of capital stock throughout the book.


%+++++++++ Catabolism ++++++++++
\subsection{Catabolism (energy production)}
\label{sec:catabolism}
%+++++++++

Catabolic processes break down and destroy material stocks within an organism
through an oxidation process.
At the cellular level, catabolic oxidation releases chemical free energy, 
some of which synthesizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
thereby providing fuel to cells. 
The rest of the released energy is manifest as waste heat.
One of the waste products of cellular catabolism is CO$_2$.

The analogy between catabolic processes and the work 
of the energy sector in the economy is striking.
Power plants (fired by coal, oil, and natural gas) break down fossil fuels
in an oxidation process (combustion) to produce useful energy 
(typically, electricity or mechanical drive~\cite{Ayres:2010ug}), 
thereby providing energy to other sectors of the economy.
Both waste heat and CO$_2$ are byproducts of combustion, 
and O$_2$ is consumed in the process.

We focus on energy production in the economic context 
in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}.


%+++++++++ Autophagy ++++++++++
\subsection{Autophagy (recycling)}
\label{sec:autophagy}
%+++++++++

One catabolic pathway, autophagy, 
involves the breakdown of damaged, unneeded, or dysfunctional cellular components 
(proteins and cell organelles)
for the purpose of re-use within the organism. 
Autophagy can be an adaptive response to low calorie intake,
promoting cell survival.

Again, the analogy between cellular metabolism and the economy is striking.
Whereas cellular autophagy repurposes proteins and cell organelles
for re-use by an organism,
recycling repurposes degraded
yet economically-valuable materials
for re-use by the economy.
Furthermore, recycling can also be an adaptive response 
to reduced material and energy inputs.
One famous example can be found on the streets of Cuba.
In the face of economic sanctions,
government restrictions on vehicle purchases, and
high import tariffs,
automobile imports by Cuba are very low.
As a result, Cuba hyper-recycles autos that were imported
prior to sanctions and manufactures replacement parts locally.
The average lifespan of automobiles has been extended
such that an estimated 60,000, pre-1960 cars~\cite{Schweid:2004aa} 
(so-called ``yank tanks'') are in service on the island.%
	\footnote{Despite the recent change allowing new car purchases by individuals,
	astronomical import taxes mean that Cuban streets remain populated 
	with vintage 1950s autos.\cite{Ramey:2014aa}
	}
(See Figure~\ref{fig:vintage_autos_cuba}.)

to the economy to a trickle.%
	\footnote{
	See Section~\ref{sec:stall_non-renewable_stocks}
	for a discussion of depletion of a non-recyclable natural resource, oil.	
	}
Regardless of the origin of material constraints, 
the effect on the economy will be the same:
re-use, recycling, and, where possible, substitution to other resources
will become increasingly imperative.

We focus on recycling in Section~\ref{sec:recycling}.

%The metabolism metaphor brings to light issues of scale (size)
%for economies and societies.
%First, scale is directly related to material flow rates.
%Larger organisms consume food at higher rates,
%in part to obtain essential nutrients to replenish cellular structures.
%**** Mik--can you add more here? ****
%Similarly, economies with higher levels of emplaced capital
%require larger material flow rates to provide 
%raw materials to machines and food to people.
%(See Section~\ref{sec:stall_capital_stock} for more on this topic.)
%
%Second, scale is directly related to metabolic energy requirements.
%For example, the well-known Harris-Benedict equation 
%(\ref{eq:harris_benedict_women}--\ref{eq:harris_benedict_men})
%shows that human resting energy expenditure ($REE$) 
%is positively correlated with both body weight ($w$) and height ($h$)
%for both women~(subscript~$f$) 
%and men~(subscript~$m$).\cite[Table~3, Equations~3 and~6]{Roza:1984aa}
%%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:harris_benedict_women}
%	REE_f = 447.593  \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day}}
%			+ 3.098 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-cm}} \; h
%			+ 9.247 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-kg}} \; w

%			- 5.677 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-year}} \; a 
%\end{equation}
%%
%If the economy is society's metabolism and 
%the scale of an organism corresponds to the inventory 
%of capital stock in an economy, 
%the metabolism metaphor suggests that larger economies 
%will require a higher rate of energy supply.
%In fact, we know this to be true.
%Built-out, industrialized economies with higher levels of emplaced capital
%(those with more roads, cars, and buildings)
%consume energy at a higher rate, both in an absolute sense and on a per-capita basis,
%compared to developing economies.

%%%%%%%%%% Metabolism metaphor helps %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{[MKH] Benefits of the metabolism metaphor}
\label{sec:metabolism_helps}
%%%%%%%%%%

The metabolism metaphor is compelling, 
because it helps us to see more clearly
and understand more deeply
how the real economy operates.
But how does the metabolism metaphor lead us to a better understanding 
of the coupling between the biosphere and the economy 
and provide guidance for more-comprehensive national accounting?

In terms of a better understanding of the economy, 
the metabolism metaphor teaches us that the economy is a biophysical entity
that requires both materials and energy for survival.
We learn that economic activity is \emph{natural}.
It can be likened to breathing (respiration): 
O$_2$ is consumed as CO$_2$ is produced.
It can be likened to digestion:
raw materials and chemical potential energy are ingested, 
the body grows, 
and energy is provided for everyday activities.
Just as food from the biosphere provides materials and energy for
anabolic and catabolic processes in an organism, 
materials and fuels from the biosphere provide matter and energy for
capital formation and energy production in society.
Without materials and energy from the biosphere, 
metabolisms fail and organisms die. 
Without materials and energy from the biosphere,
the economies collapse and societies fade away.
In short, the economy is coupled to the biosphere,
because it is utterly and completely dependent upon it.

The metabolism metaphor teaches us that limits to economic growth
are both possible and expected.
From the metaphor we learn that economic ``stall'' is not pathological, 
but natural, especially in mature economies 
that have encountered some type of biophysical limit.
(See Section~\ref{sec:stall_non-renewable_stocks}.)
We might expect to encounter any number of limits:
supply rates of materials from the biosphere,
supply rates of energy from the biosphere,
scale of the economy relative to the biosphere.
In the metabolism metaphor, autophagy indicates that stocks 
of capital within society are reservoirs of 
material and (embodied) energy that can and should be 
broken down and re-used or re-purposed,
rather than discarded, 
when out of service.

Through an understanding of the deep interconnectedness and complexity
of organisms and species in the biosphere, 
we come to appreciate the interdependence 
among actors within and sectors of the economy.
Furthermore, an appreciation of the complex nature of economies leads us 
to acknowledge the difficulty in discerning
precisely which limit(s) is (are) encountered when growth stalls.
In fact, there is no single explanation 
for the slowdown of growth in OECD economies 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:growth_has_slowed}.
The best explanation to date involves many intertwining factors: 
slowing growth of energy input rate, 
decreasing energy return on investment in the liquid fuel sector,
problems in the credit markets, etc.

In terms of national accounting, 
a deeper understanding of the metabolism metaphor 
will lead to significant changes in national accounting.
It will lead us to acknowledge
the important role of \emph{both} flows 
(e.g., GDP, 
rates of material and energy extraction from the bioshere,
rates at which money spins through the economy)
and stocks 
(e.g., manufactured capital, monetary savings, non-renewable energy supplies).
Furthermore, appreciation of the physical basis of the real economy will lead us 
to account for \emph{both} stocks and flows 
in physical units (kg and kJ) as well as financial units (currency).

Deeper understanding of the metabolic metaphor will
lead systems of national accounts to become
focused as much on stocks as on flows.
Systems of national accounts will expand beyond financial accounting
to become a compendia of both physical as well as financial assets
of an economy.
By counting flows \emph{and} stocks 
in both physical and monetary units,
national accounting will provide a comprehensive picture 
of the \emph{health} and \emph{wealth} of economies, respectively.

**** 

BRH--Perhaps write about what changes have happened in the OECD SEEA.

Note that our suggested changes are already 
emerging internationally at the economy-wide scale.

There would be benefits to applying these changes at the inter-sectoral level, too.

%%%%%%%%%% Rigorous framework %%%%%%%%%%
\section{[MKH] New national accounting}
\label{sec:new_national_accounting}
%%%%%%%%%%

Society needs to respond 
to the material and energy shortages that
we now face (Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}),
and part of that response
should involve more-comprehensive national accounting 
(Section~\ref{sec:metabolism_helps}) 
guided by a deeper understanding of the real economy 
gained through the metabolism metaphor (Section~\ref{sec:economy_metabolism}).
It is imperative that we begin
to help society deal with impending biophysical limits.

But how? 
What should we be counting and in what units?
And, how should the data be analyzed?

Firm theoretical grounding is needed 
\emph{before} we begin the process of expanding national accounts.
We need a framework, a way to organize our thoughts about the notion 
of national accounting in the age of resource depletion.
This book is an attempt to provide just that: 
a theoretical framework
for comprehensive national accounting
in the age of resource depletion
that could be adopted in systems of national accounts.

The first question above (``What should we be counting and in what units?'') 
is the topic for the remainder of this section,
and the answer provides the structure for the heart of the book.
The second question above (``How should the data be analyzed?'')
is the topic of Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.

We believe the key to understanding society's metabolism
in the age of resource depletion is to understand how 
materials, energy, embodied energy, and economic value
each interacts with the economy.
Specifically, it is important to understand how each
accumulates within the economy and how each flows into, within, and out of the economy.
The first three items (materials, energy, and embodied energy) are
inspired directly by the metabolism metaphor.
The fourth item (economic value) is necessary to understand the way 
that the lifeblood of economies (currency) flows through the economy.
Of course, each of the items in the list interacts with the others 
and the biosphere dynamically.
If we can begin to carefully track these items, 
we will be on our way toward gathering the information necessary to 
expand national accounting.

Systems of national accounts that are informed by the metabolism metaphor 
and account for materials, energy, embodied energy, and economic value
may allow consumers, producers,
and policy-makers to answer critical questions that are not
answerable today, such as:

**** Do we like the questions bold? ****

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{How much energy was used in the manufacture and transport
				of two competing goods in the supermarket?} 
				(Or, equivalently, how much energy is embodied 
				in two competing goods in the supermarket?)}
	\item{\textbf{What might be the optimal scale of an economy in terms of GDP 
				and what are the impacts of an optimally-sized economy on natural capital?}}
    \item{\textbf{How is scarce fossil fuel dependency embedded 
    			in the interlocking fabric of the economy?}} 
    \item{\textbf{How will economies that are dependent on coal, oil, 
     			and other forms of non-renewable energy transition 
    			to renewable forms of energy?}}
	\item{\textbf{How might an economy be affected as an increasing share of production
				is directed toward replacing 
				degraded ecosystem services?}~\cite[p.~221]{kummel2011}​}
\end{enumerate}

Our approach to developing a rigorous theoretical foundation for 
comprehensive national accounting is to
develop a dynamic model 
by applying rigorous thermodynamics 
to materials and energy flows into, among, 
and out of economic sectors,
informed by the metabolism metaphor,
in a manner that is verifiable against 
the existing (or expanded) 
national accounts.


%%%%%%%%%% Structure %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Structure of the book}
\label{sec:structure}
%%%%%%%%%%

The list of items to be accounted 
(materials, energy, embodied energy, and economic value)
provides structure for our proposed framework
and much of the rest of this book.

Part~\ref{part:matter} addresses flows of physical matter and energy
through the economy.
Chapter~\ref{chap:materials} discusses material flows and accumulation.
Flows of energy are covered in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}, 
and a rigorous, thermodynamics-based definition of and accounting for 
embodied energy is presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.

In Part~\ref{part:values}, we turn to flow and accumulation of 
non-physical entities through the economy. 
Flows and accumulation of economic value are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:value}.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}, we combine the results from 
Chapters~\ref{chap:embodied_energy} and~\ref{chap:value} to
develop an important indicator of economic activity:
the energy intensity of economic production.

Part~\ref{part:implications} gives context to the framework developed in
Parts~\ref{part:matter}~and~\ref{part:values}.
Chapter~\ref{chap:implications} draws out some of the direct implications
of our model.
Chapter~\ref{chap:unfinished_business} looks at 
unfinished business: practical, conceptual, and theoretical issues
that arise in the development of our new model.
And, we end with a summary in Chapter~\ref{chap:summary}.

Throughout the methodological chapters~(\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:intensity}),
our accounting framework is developed
through a series of increasingly-disaggregated
models of the economy~(Table~\ref{tab:examplesABC}),
and we use the US auto industry 
as a running example for application and discussion.

The next two paragraphs are duplicated from 
Section 3.5 (Materials in the US Auto Industry).
We duplicated them here temporarily so that the editors can 
see the purpose of and justification for the auto industry example. 

****

The running example of the US auto industry demonstrates that our dynamic model 
can be tied into national accounts.
The US auto industry example shows where data are available 
(e.g., economic value, Chapter~\ref{chap:value}), 
where it is old (e.g., energy intensity, Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}), 
and where it has never been available 
(e.g., accumulated embodied energy, Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}).  
The US auto industry is, therefore, 
illustrative of the challenges inherent 
in obtaining data that would feed the model.

The auto industry 
has been used previously
in the literature in both 
process-based~\cite{Berry:1973vo, Sullivan1995, Stodolsky1995, 
							Sullivan1998, McCleese2002, Sullivan2010, Hawkins2012}
and Input-Output~\cite{Bullard:1978vd, MacLean1998, MacLean2003}
analysis methods,
Furthermore, the industry
remains a large portion of many industrialized economies, 
is very resource intensive, 
has obvious links with energy because
its health is sensitive to disruptions in energy supplies, and
the industry also shows evidence of 
post-industrial decline (shrinking profit margins, etc.).
