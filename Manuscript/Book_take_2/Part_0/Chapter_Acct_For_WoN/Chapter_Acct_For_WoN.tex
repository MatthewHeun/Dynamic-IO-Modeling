Why is society doing the accounting incorrectly? 
Because we do not have correct assumptions about the way the economy works. 
Why are our assumptions incorrect? 

Make the distinction between physical and value accounting.

Make a distinction between stocks of natural and manufactured capital.


%%%%%%%%%% Metaphors and Models %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Metaphors and models}
\label{sec:metaphors_and_models}
%%%%%%%%%%

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:incomplete_accounting}, 
national accounting is incomplete, and
an objective for this book is to provide rigorous theoretical grounding for 
a better national accounting framework.
But, before moving ahead with developing that framework,
it is useful to consider how society has come to this point.
How is it that we don't routinely and comprehensively account for
important material and energy flows into, within, and out of the economy
in systems of national accounts?

The classical economists certainly appreciated the dependence of
economic activity on bio-physical processes.\cite{Hall2011, Cleveland1987, Dale2012}
However, somewhere between William Stanley Jevons' 1865
assessment that
``the very existence of Britain, as a great nation''~\cite[IV.3]{Jevons1865}
was tied to a continued supply of low-cost coal 
and Julian Simon's 1998 statement that
``natural resources are not finite in any economic sense,''~\cite[p.~54]{Simon1998} %chktex 38
the importance of the biosphere was lost.
In the following sections, we argue that
a contributing reason for incomplete national accounting
is that we have the wrong metaphor for the economy,
and we provide a suggestion for a better metaphor.


%+++++++++ The clockwork metaphor ++++++++++
\subsection{The clockwork metaphor}
\label{sec:clockwork_metaphor}
%+++++++++

Most economics textbooks today depict the economy 
as in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}.
Goods and services flow from the production sector
to the household sector~(consumption)
in exchange for payments.
The factors of production (labor and capital)
flow from the household sector to the
production sector in exchange for wages and rents (income).
Attention is primarily focused on the circular flow
of money~(dashed line).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_1.pdf}
\caption[The traditional model]{In the traditional model, the economy 
is represented as a circular flow of goods and services between two sectors. 
Producers manufacture goods and services 
by taking in labor and capital. 
Consumers exchange labor for wages 
which are used to purchase 
the goods and services of the producers.}
\label{fig:perp_motion_1}
\end{figure}

This traditional model of the economy~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}) 
is unashamedly mechanistic.
General equilibrium models of the economy
~\cite{Walras1892, Walras1993}
were borrowed directly from classical physics' models of 
mechanical equilibrium which, in turn, arose from the 
``clockwork universe'' metaphor.\cite{Ingrao1990}
The clockwork metaphor is a simplification 
that helps us make sense of the world around us.
Like all metaphors, it informs our thinking about the real world,
but, consequently,
it also constrains our ability to frame reality.
Erroneously, we mistake the model-metaphor for reality, and
we interact with reality in the same manner 
as we interact with the abstract objects of our
models.\footnote{This fallacious process is known as
	\emph{reification}; the making (\emph{facere}, Latin) real of
	something (\emph{res}, Latin) that is merely an idea.
	Alfred Whitehead refers to this as
	\emph{the fallacy of misplaced concreteness}.\cite{Whitehead2011}
	}
Classical physics told us the universe was
\emph{like} clockwork, 
so we began to interact with the universe
as if it \emph{really were} clockwork.
It then became easy to collect economic data that confirmed the clockwork model,
because the model told us which data to collect.

The clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy
preclude any sort of connection 
between the economy and the biosphere.
Thus, only the internal dynamics of the economy are important. 
They tell us that natural resources are unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere will always provide.
If a particular resource becomes scarce, 
substitution to a different, more-readily-available resource will be made.
Wastes are quantitatively unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere has infinite assimilative capacity.
Economic forces (through prices and the market mechanism) 
are thought to effectively guide any necessary transition
within the economy.
With the clockwork metaphor, physical constraints 
imposed by the biosphere 
on allocation of resources, distribution of outputs, and 
scale of an economy 
are outside the scope of neoclassical economic discussion.\cite{Daly1995}
In short, the clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy 
tell us that the clockwork-economy can and will carry on.

Because Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} has no flow of energy
into the economy,
we may consider the traditional model of the economy 
to be a perpetual motion machine of the \emph{first kind}:
the economy works without the input of energy, thus violating
the First Law of Thermodynamics---the 
law of conservation of energy.\cite{Rao2004}


%%%%%%%%%% Resource metaphors %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The machine metaphor}
\label{sec:machine_metaphor}
%%%%%%%%%% 

The limits of the clockwork metaphor and traditional model of the economy were 
exposed by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
The global economy
``stalled'' due to lack of 
a single, highly-constrained resource:
fuel.
Many came to realize that input energy is required
for successful operation of an economic ``engine.''
Thus, a machine metaphor and 
accompanying engine model for the economy 
rose to prominence
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The need to include energy resources
in the economic picture
spurred the efforts of early (net) energy 
analysts.\cite{Gilliland1975, Chapman1976}

The engine model (Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}) 
accounts for energy flows from the biosphere 
to the economy.
With the new metaphor, the economy changed from 
an \emph{isolated} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}) to 
a \emph{closed} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}). 
The importance of input energy was acknowledged, 
but wastes are missing.
And, the biosphere is relegated to the position
of provider of energy resources;
the larder and gas station of the economy.\cite{Norgaard2010}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_2.pdf}
\caption[The machine model]{The machine model of the economy includes
flows of energy into the economy from the biosphere.
This may be considered a perpetual motion machine 
of the second kind.}
\label{fig:perp_motion_2}
\end{figure}

The machine metaphor and engine model,
like the clockwork metaphor and traditional model,
are mechanistic.
Much like the engines of the Industrial Revolution,
the economic engine is assumed to be well-behaved and amenable to control.
Even today, machine metaphors abound in our economic discussions.
We continue to speak of ``fueling'' the ``economic engine'' 
lest it should ``stall.''~\cite{Liu2012}
Like a well-running engine, the economy is assumed 
to be resilient to small or even quite large perturbations.  
It can either self-correct, 
or be corrected predictably with adjustments to
a few policy levers.

But how accurate is the engine model?

According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
all real-world processes involve the degradation
of material and, especially, energy resources
and the creation of entropy.  
High quality (low entropy) material and energy come in;
low quality (high entropy) material and energy go out.
Wastes exist!
The depiction of the economy in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2} 
can be classified as a perpetual motion machine
of the \emph{second kind}:
it perfectly converts energy resources into 
work~(useful energy services) without generating
any entropy,
in violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Because the generation of high entropy~(low quality)
output is a \emph{necessary} feature of \emph{all} processes 
(including economic processes),
the generation of wastes is a \emph{normal} feature of
the economy,
not an anomaly.

We need a different model.
We need a new metahpor.


%%%%%%%%%% Economy is society's metabolism %%%%%%%%%%
\section{The economy is society's metabolism}
\label{sec:economy_metabolism}
%%%%%%%%%%

In our opinion, an apt metaphor for the economy should account for the following facts 
about real economies. 
Economies:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\label{itm:intake}intake material and energy from the biosphere}
	\item{\label{itm:internal_exchange}exchange materials, energy, and information internally}
	\item{\label{itm:discharge}discharge material and energy wastes to the biosphere}
	\item{\label{itm:energetic_costs}are affected by energetic costs}
	\item{\label{itm:scarcity}are affected non-linearly by scarcity

	\item{\label{itm:non-linear}can change non-linearly or in discrete steps with the potential

	\item{\label{itm:embodies}accumulate embodied energy in material stocks, and}
	\item{\label{itm:robust}maintain organizational structure despite changes 
			in their environment.%
				\footnote{We note that 
				several areas of the literature speak to the items in this list.
				Material Flow Analysis~(MFA) and 
				Economy-Wide Material Flow Analys~(EW-MFA)
				stress the importance of
				material intake by the economy. 
				(See Section~\ref{sec:materials_auto}.)
				The Input-Output~(I-O) method highlights the effects of internal exchanges

				and increases energy prices.
				(See Sections~\ref{sec:B_energy} 
				and~\ref{sec:resource_quality_and_irreversibility}.)
				The Energy Input-Output~(EI-O) method gives prominence to energetic costs

			}}
\end{enumerate}

Living metabolisms%
	\footnote{The 
	Greek root of metabolism 
	(\emph{metabol$\bar{e}$}) means ``change.''}
exhibit the characteristics in the list above.
Metabolisms and the organisms they support
are intimately connected with the biosphere:
they withdraw materials and energy from the biosphere~(\ref{itm:intake}), 
transfer materials and energy internally via metabolic processes~(\ref{itm:internal_exchange}),
and discharge wastes back to the biosphere~(\ref{itm:discharge});
in fact, their very survival depends on these processes.
Extending Figures~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} and~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}
to include the facts in items~(\ref{itm:intake})--(\ref{itm:discharge}), % chktex 36
we obtain Figure~\ref{fig:metabolic_economy}.
Metabolisms are affected by energetic costs~(\ref{itm:energetic_costs}): 
an organism that obtains less energy than it expends is doomed.
Withholding life-sustaining resources brings drastic, non-linear
consequences for any metabolism~(\ref{itm:scarcity}).
Metabolisms enable non-linear, structural transformations
in their host organisms (e.g., metamorphosis, puberty, and evolution)~(\ref{itm:non-linear}).
And, energy absorbed by a metabolism is considered to be ``embodied''
in the cells of the organism~(\ref{itm:embodies}).
Metabolisms exist in a state of dynamic stability~(\ref{itm:robust}),
adjusting and readjusting to maintain their internal conditions
despite changes in the environment;
for a metabolism, equilibrium means death!

The economy is society's metabolism.\cite{Giampietro2000, Giampietro2013, F-K1999}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/PERKS.pdf}
\caption[The metabolism model]{The metabolism model provides a comprehensive view 
of the economy, fully consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, 
including degraded resources (waste) expelled 
to the environment as a necessary consequence of economic activity.}
\label{fig:metabolic_economy}
\end{figure}

Although we're not the first to utilize the metabolism metaphor for the economy,
[Fischer-Kowalski; Gowdy; Heijman; Liu; Giamietro]
we believe that, to date, 
the metabolism metaphor is under-utililzed 
on both practical and theoretical levels.
On the practical level, the metabolism metaphor is under-utilized
because national accounting, to date, 
is built upon the machine metaphor and engine model for the economy
(Section~\ref{sec:machine_metaphor}).
This book attempts to correct that oversight 
by using the metabolic metaphor 
to develop a rigorous theoretical framework 
for comprehensive national accounting.
(See Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:intensity}.)
On a theoretical level, the metabolism metaphor is under-utilized because 
most researchers (with the exception of Giampietro~\cite{Giampietro2000, Giampietro2013})
use the metabolism metaphor as a framing device for analyses of
raw material flows into the economy for the purpose of understanding 
stocks of raw materials in the biosphere.%
	\footnote{The field most closely associated with the metabolism metaphor is
	Materials Flow Analysis (MFA). 
	To be fair, materials flow analysts clearly acknowledge that 
	materials flow into the economy (minerals and ores, especially),
	in part,
	for the purpose of building up stocks of technical infrastructure (buildings),
	livestock, and people.\cite[p.~116]{F-K1999} 
	However, there is little emphasis on quantifying \emph{levels} 
	of material stock in Materials \emph{Flow} Analysis, 
	as its name implies.
	In fact, the equations in MFA~\cite[Equation~1]{F-K1999} are almost always written as%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{inflow} = \mathrm{outflow} + \mathrm{accumulation,}
	\end{equation*}
	reflecting the focus on flows.
	In this book, similar equations 
	(see Equation~\ref{eq:general_accumulation_equation}) 
	are written as%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{accumulation} = \mathrm{inflow} - \mathrm{outflow,}
	\end{equation*}
	thereby focusing on accumulation.
	}
Those who employ the metabolism metaphor for the economy
tend to focus little attention on capital stock within the economy itself.
In effect, this is the same oversight as national accounting: 
under-appreciation of the important role of capital
in determining material and energy demand 
for the emplacement, use, maintenance, and replacement of the very same capital.

It becomes a vicious cycle. 
By not accounting for capital stock on a physical basis 
in national accounting (see Section~\ref{sec:incomplete_accounting}), 
society unable to appreciate 
the important physical role that capital stock plays in the economy.
Because society under-appreciates the physical role of capital stock in the economy, 
there is little urgency to begin accounting 
for manufactured capital on a physical (rather than financial) basis.

We think that a deeper understanding of the metabolic metaphor
can both highlight the physical role of manufactured capital stock and 
provide the basis for a rigorous theoretical framework 
for comprehensive national accounting.
In the following sections, 
we deepen the metabolism metaphor by considering 
anabolism (capital formation),
catabolism (energy production),
autophagy (recycling), and
issues of scale.


%+++++++++ Anabolism ++++++++++
\subsection{Anabolism (capital formation)}
\label{sec:anabolism}
%+++++++++

Metabolic processes are classified as anabolic and catabolic 
(Section~\ref{sec:catabolism}).
Anabolic process build up materials within the body (bones, muscles, tissues).
For example, anabolic steriods are hormones that stimulate 
the human body's natural muscle and bone growth processes.
Anabolic processes are fueled by the breakdown 
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cellular energy source.
Raw materials for anabolic processes are provided by food, 
which, ultimately, comes from the biosphere.

The economic analog to biological anabolism is capital formation, 
net addition to the stock of capital within a period of time.
Traditionally, capital formation is measured in currency units.
Thus, capital formation is the financial evidence 
of the emplacement of manufactured infrastructure.
Whereas biological anabolism is fueled by ATP, 
capital formation is fueled by the energy sector of the economy.
The raw material for capital formation comes to the 
economy from the biosphere.

We discuss extraction and use of materials in Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}
and the importance of capital stock throughout the book.


%+++++++++ Catabolism ++++++++++
\subsection{Catabolism (energy production)}
\label{sec:catabolism}
%+++++++++

Catabolic processes break down and destroy material stocks within an organism
through an oxidation process.
At the cellular level, catabolic oxidation releases chemical free energy, 
some of which synthesizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
thereby providing fuel to cells. 
The rest of the released energy is manifest as waste heat.
One of the waste products of cellular catabolism is CO$_2$.

The analogy between catabolic processes and the work 
of the energy sector in the economy is striking.
Power plants (fired by coal, oil, and natural gas) break down fossil fuels
in an oxidation process (combustion) to produce useful energy 
(typically, electricity or mechanical drive), 
thereby providing energy to other sectors of the economy.
Both waste heat and CO$_2$ are byproducts of combustion.
Economic activity is analogous to breathing:
O$_2$ from the atmosphere is used to reduce carbon to CO$_2$.

We focus on energy production in the economic context 
in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}.


%+++++++++ Autophagy ++++++++++
\subsection{Autophagy (recycling)}
\label{sec:autophagy}
%+++++++++

One catabolic pathway, autophagy, 
involves the breakdown of damaged, unneeded, or dysfunctional cellular compoenents 
(protiens and cell organelles)
for the purpose of re-use within the organism. 
Autophagy can be an adaptive response to low calorie intake,
promoting cell survival.

Again, the analogy between cellular metabolism and the economy is striking.
Whereas cellular autophagy repurposes proteins and cell organelles
for re-use by an organism,
recycling repurposes degraded
yet economically-valuable materials
for re-use by the economy.
Furthermore, recycling can also be an adaptive response 
to reduced material and energy inputs.
One famous example can be found on the streets of Cuba.
In the face of economic sanctions,
government restrictions on vehicle purchases, and
high import tariffs,
automobile imports by Cuba are very low.
As a result, Cuba hyper-recycles autos that were imported
prior to sanctions and manufactures replacement parts locally.
The average lifespan of automobiles has been extended
such that an estimated 60,000, pre-1960 cars~\cite{Schweid:2004aa} 
(so-called ``yank tanks'') are in service on the island.%
	\footnote{Despite the recent change allowing new car purchases by individuals,
	astronomical import taxes mean that Cuban streets remain populated 
	with vintage 1950s autos.\cite{Ramey:2014aa}
	}
(See Figure~\ref{fig:vintage_autos_cuba}.)

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig:vintage_autos_cuba}
\end{figure}

If we can't obtain rights to Figure~\ref{fig:vintage_autos_cuba}, 
other options include:

\url{http://ocean.otr.usm.edu/~w301497/travels/cuba2010/cuba2010b.html}

It's not hard to imagine that dynamics similar to Cuba will emerge
if any important resource is significantly depleted from the biosphere and the inflow rate
to the economy decreases to a trickle.
Regardless of the origin of material and energy constraints, 
the effect on the economy will be the same:
re-use, recycling, and, where possible, substitution to other resources
will become increasingly imperative.

We focus on recycling in Section~\ref{sec:recycling}.


%+++++++++ Scale ++++++++++
\subsection{Issues of scale}
\label{sec:metabolic_scale}
%+++++++++

The metabolism metaphor brings to light issues of scale (size)
for economies and societyies.
First, scale is directly related to energy requirements.
For example, the famous Harris Benedict equation 
(\ref{eq:harris_benedict_women}--\ref{eq:harris_benedict_men})
shows that human resting energy expenditure ($REE$) 
is positively correlated with both body weight ($w$) and height ($h$)
and inversely correlated with age ($a$) for both women~(subscript~$f$)
and men~(subscript~$m$).\cite[Table~3, Equations~3 and~6]{Roza:1984aa}
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:harris_benedict_women}
	REE_f = 447.593  \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day}}
			+ 3.098 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-cm}} \; h
			+ 9.247 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-kg}} \; w
			- 4.330 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-year}} \; a
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:harris_benedict_men}
	REE_m = 88.362 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day}} 
			+ 4.799 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-cm}} \; h
			+ 13.397 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-kg}} \; w 
			- 5.677 \, \mathrm{\scriptstyle \frac{kcal}{day-year}} \; a 
\end{equation}
%
If the economy is society's metabolism and 
the scale of an organism corresponds to the capital inventory of an economy, 
the metaphor suggests that larger economies 
will require a higher rate of energy supply.
In fact, we know this to be true.
Built-out, industrialized economies with higher levels of emplaced capital
(those with better roads and cars and those with more buildings)
consume more energy both in an absolute sense and on a per-capita basis
compared to developing economies.

Second, the scale of an organism or an economy 
is important relative to the encompassing biosphere.
The dynamics of population boom-bust cycles are
well-known to systems ecologists:
rapid population growth (boom),
leads to overconsumption of food supply
causing species die-off (bust).
Thus, in nature, physical size (``scale'') of a species
realtive to the ecosystem services provided by the biosphere
is a determinitive factor for survival.

**** Becky, can you fill in some details here and in the following paragraph? ****
The economic analogy is a ``Malthusian'' economy.
When an economy grows to the point where it is consuming food 
at a faster rate than it is grown,
population declines in what is known as a ``Malthusian catastrophe.''

Interestingly, no systems ecologist would contend that 
a species is free from the boom-bust cycles caused by biosphere constraints.
However, economists claim that many economies have escaped the ``Malthusian trap''
in that (to date) the incredible population boom
of the industrial revolution has not been followed by a population bust.

Malthus discredited, because food production has kept up with population.
Using fossil fuels to make that happen.

%%%%%%%%%% Metabolism metaphor helps %%%%%%%%%%
\section{[MKH] Metabolism metaphor assists understanding}
\label{sec:metabolism_helps}
%%%%%%%%%%

Section~\ref{sec:economy_metabolism} above presents a compelling case 
in favor of the metabolism metaphor.
But, how does the metabolism metaphor lead us to a better understanding 
of the economy, of economic processes, and national accounting?

In terms of a better understanding of the economy, 
if society took the metabolism metaphor seriously, 
we would see the biosphere as sustaining the economy 
in terms of both materials and energy.
Just as food from the biosphere provides matter and energy for
anabolic and catabolic processes in an organism, 
materials and fuels from the biosphere provide matter and energy for
captial formation and energy production in the economy.
Without them, the economy withers and dies.
Furthermore, economic respiration is utterly and completely dependent upon 
the biosphere.

As a society, we would come to understand that limits to economic growth
are both possible and expected.
We would see that economic ``stall'' is not pathological, 
but natural and to be expected of mature economies 
that have encountered some type of limit. 
We might expect to encounter any number of limits:
supply rates of materials energy from the biosphere,
scale of the economy relative to the biosphere, and
complexity.
We would understand that it can be difficult to discern 
what limit(s) is (are) encountered, due to 
the interconnectedness both among actors and sectors within the economy
and between the economy and the environment.

We would understand that it is impossible to understand thoroughly 
economic processes and their interactions with the biosphere
unless you have knowledge of both \emph{both} flows
(GDP, 
rates of material extraction from the bioshere,
rates at which money spins through the economy)
and stocks 
(capital, savings, energy).
Furthermore, we would realize that 
knowledge of stocks and flows 
is important in \emph{both} physical units (kg and kJ) as well as financial units (currenty).

We would understand that stocks of capital within society are reservoirs of 
(embodied) energy that can and should be broken town and re-used (autophagy)
rather than discarded 
when out of service.

These deeper understandings would, presumably, lead systems of national accounts to be 
focused as much on stocks as on flows.
Systems of national accounts tould expand beyond the financial
to become compendia of both the physical as well as the financial assets
of an economy, its \emph{wealth}.
