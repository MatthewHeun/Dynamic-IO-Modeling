\label{sec:wrong_metaphor}
%%%%%%%%%%

Why is society doing the accounting incorrectly? 
Because we do not have correct assumptions about the way the economy works. 
Why are our assumptions incorrect? 
Because we have the wrong metaphor for the economy? 
It is time to update the metaphor.

The economy is societyâ€™s metabolism.




%%%%%%%%%% Economy is society's metabolism %%%%%%%%%%
\section{[MKH] The economy is society's metabolism}
\label{sec:economy_metabolism}
%%%%%%%%%%

The economy as society's metabolism 
has been introduced recently (Fischer-Kowalski; Gowdy; Heijman; Liu) 
to clearly identify economic activity as an interchange 
with the biosphere; 
energy and materials flow from the biosphere through society.

The metabolism metaphor has not been utilized to its full extent. 
Until now, the metabolism metaphor for the economy 
has been focused on flows, not stocks! 
[exception Giampietro] 
(Same mistake as the economists are making.)

Anabolic process build up material stocks with the body (bones, muscle mass, tissues).

Catabolic processes break down molecules to release energy.

Larger bodies (more stock) require large flow rates, even at rest.

All metabolisms exist within the context of the encompassing biosphere.

Size (scale) of the organism relative to the biosphere 
is an important limiting factor 
for expansion of species whose individual organisms 
are supported by similar metabolisms.

Hypermetabolism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermetabolism).
