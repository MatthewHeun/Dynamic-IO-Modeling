The vast majority of physical scientists are concerned that quality of life may very well decrease in the future. Limits to the amounts and rates at which resources can be extracted, the rate of wastes (including anthropogenic carbon emissions) that can be assimilated, and
 the rate at which human ingenuity can substitute for depletion of natural capital are already being encountered. The future health and
 viability of all economies is at risk.\cite{IPCC2013} Conversely, the vast majority of economists and policy-makers predict that
 quality of life into the future will continue to improve. Economists point out that standards of living have increased steadily over time,
 and living standards for even the poorest nations are ``accelerating markedly.’’~\cite{Malik:2013aa} GDP per capita is expected to
 grow continuously and quality of life will continue to improve. Graphs that extrapolate GDP per capita into the future show increasing
 trends under even the most pessimistic assumptions.~\cite[p. 170]{Malik:2013aa} The OECD, for example, forecasts an average global
 growth rate in GDP of approximately 2\%/year for the next several decades.\cite[Table A.1]{OECD2012}


There is a stark contrast between these two visions of the future, because the two groups (scientists and economists) focus on 
different parts of the economy: scientists observe that the planet's natural capital is dwindling, 
which should lead to a declining quality of life.
 While, conversely, economists observe that the stock of manufactured capital is growing, and growing increasingly efficient, which
 should continue to provide an increasing level of income and quality of life. 


The differences between scientists and economists revolve around the understanding and role of capital.
Economists understand that manufactured capital is a primary ``factor of production,'' but they overlook the role of natural capital. 
In contrast, physical scientists often focus on natural capital but ignore manufactured capital. In fact, natural capital is required to
 produce, operate, and maintain manufactured capital. And, a direct correlation exists between the efficiency of manufactured capital
 and economic quality of life. Both types of capital are important parts of the production process, because both forms of capital provide
 wealth that generates income. Furthermore, both natural and manufactured capital depreciate over time as they are used.
 Manufactured capital ``wears out,’’ thereby reducing production capacity. And, we ``use up’’ natural capital when forests are cut
 down, fossil fuels are depleted, clean air and water are polluted, and wetlands are degraded. As natural capital dwindles, the future
 capacity for income generation also dwindles. Such depletion of natural capital is the primary concern of many scientists, and it should
 be concerning to everyone!

Nations use Systems of National Accounts (SNAs) to gather, evaluate, and disseminate economic statistics concerning income and
 assets. The focus of national accounting centers on income. Over the last two hundred years, the stock of manufactured capital has
 dramatically increased, and had continued to grow increasingly efficient. Human ingenuity has provided replacements for much of the
 natural capital that has been used up. This has possibly lulled nations into believing that they do not need to manage their portfolio of
 capital assets. Natural capital is not included in SNAs. Even manufactured capital is given little ``shelf space.’’ Instead, the spotlight
 shines on GDP as the measure of a nation’s economic state. This predilection results in SNAs that collect and analyze a trove of data to
 produce a robust \emph{income statement} for the economy (GDP) yet mostly ignore the data needed to produce a similarly rigorous
 \emph{balance sheet} that tracks the value of a nations’ wealth (manufactured and natural capital). Without a complete national
 balance sheet alongside an income statement, policy-makers can unwittingly draw down a nation’s wealth (natural capital) to generate
 today’s income (GDP). In so doing, future income is put at risk. 

The UN \emph{Inclusive Wealth Report 2012}~\cite{IWR2012} accounts for all forms of productive capital (natural, human, and
 manufactured). The \emph{Inclusive Wealth Report} shows that, in fact, a nation’s wealth can decline even as its GDP grows. Between
 1990-2008 GDP per capita for the US grew on average 1.8\%, while the nation's inclusive wealth grew at only 0.7\% per year. For
 other nations, inclusive wealth declined. Saudi Arabia's GDP per capita grew at 0.4\% per year, while its inclusive wealth declined at a
 rate of 1.1\% per year. In an extreme case, Nigeria's GDP per capita grew at 2.5\% per year, while its wealth declined at a rate of
 1.8\% per year.~\cite[p. 44]{IWR2012}  Indeed, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela, South Africa, and Nigeria all appear to be consuming
 their wealth (and that of future generations) to support the consumption of the current generation.

Given the above, we contend that a nation needs both a balance sheet \emph{and} an income statement to ensure its own sustainability. Nations must monitor and manage not only the goods and services it produces, but the stocks of capital that are used to produce them. Many questions are unanswerable without both:

\begin{enumerate}
     \item{How is fossil fuel dependency embedded in the interlocking fabric of the economy?} 
     \item{How will industries that are dependent on coal, oil, and other forms of non-renewable energy transition to renewable forms of energy?} 
     \item{How will industries that are dependent on the industries that are dependent non-renewable energy be affected by the transition?} 
\end{enumerate}

We're not the first to point out the importance of accounting for both manufactured and natural capital. The Brundtland Commission (1983--1987) recognized the need to devise rigorous methods for integrating environmental dimensions into national balance sheets and income statements.

\begin{quote}
The process of economic development must be more soundly based upon the realities of the stock of capital that sustains it. This is rarely
 done in either developed or developing countries. For example, income from forestry operations is conventionally measured in terms of
 the value of timber and other products extracted, minus the costs of extraction. The costs of regenerating the forest are not taken into 
account, unless money is actually spent on such work. Thus figuring profits from logging rarely takes full 
account of the losses in future revenue incurred through degradation of the forest. Similar incomplete 
accounting occurs in the exploitation of other natural resources, especially in the case of resources that 
are not capitalized in enterprise or national accounts: air, water, and soil. In all countries, rich or poor, 
economic development must take full account in its measurements of growth of the improvement or 
deterioration in the stock of natural resources.~\cite[Chapter 2, para 36]{brundtland1987}
\end{quote}

In response to the call by the Brundtland Commission, economist Peter Bartelmus headed the effort at the UN Statistics Division to
 develop the System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA).~\cite{Bartelmus1991} This set of ``satellite
 accounts’’ operates alongside and dovetails with the international standard of System of National Accounts framework for measuring
 GDP. The UN published the Handbook for the SEEA in 1993.~\cite{UNSEEA1993} The Philippines implemented SEEA in its national
 accounts at first as part of a 1993 pilot study, and then permanently.~\cite{uno1998}~\cite{PhilippinesSEEAWeb} SEEA  is currently in
 its third revision, but has been implemented in only a few countries to date.~\cite{UNSEEAWeb}~\cite{PhilippinesSEEAWeb} 

Shortly after the publication of the UN integrated environmental-economic accounting methodology, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) began development of a similar Integrated Environmental-Economic System of Accounts (IEESA) framework. The motivation, methodology, and first set of data tables were published in April, 1994.~\cite{BEA1994a} These accounts provided a range of values for the the stocks of subsoil mineral assets in the nation’s portfolio. 

Unfortunately, the progress toward environmental accounting in the US came to a screeching halt as soon as the tables were published. The US Congress responded swiftly and negatively to the publication of the first set of IEESA tables. Congress explicitly restricted the BEA from spending any more of their budget on developing or extending the integrated environmental and economic accounting methodology. In fact, the BEA was expected to turn its entire IEESA budget over to panel of members of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the BEA’s objectivity and methodology related to this work and submit a report to Congress.

\begin{quote}
The conferees understand that there has been considerable debate over the years as to the objectivity, methodology, and applicability of `Integrated Environmental-Economic Accounting' or `Green GDP'. The conferees understand that the Department has completed the development of Phase I of this initiative. the conferees believe that an independent review, by an external organization such as the National Academy of Sciences, should be conducted to analyze the proposed objectivity, methodology, and application of environmental accounting. The conferees expect BEA to use \$400,000 under this account to fund this independent study, as suggested by the House report. The conferees expect BEA to suspend development of Phase II of this initiative until the review has been completed and the results have been submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the Senate, as well as the appropriate authorizing committees.~\emph{FY 1995 HR 103-708}
\end{quote}

William Nordhaus chaired the panel of scientists to evaluate whether the BEA should extend the national income and product accounts to include ``assets and production activities associated with natural resources and the environment.’’~\cite[p. 2]{ Nordhaus1999a} In 1999, the panel submitted its comprehensive report to Congress strongly recommending that the BEA be authorized to continue producing the environmental-economic national accounts.~\cite{ Nordhaus1999a}

The report illuminates the need for a nation to keep ``comprehensive economic accounts'' that ``provide a complete reckoning of
 economic activity, whether it takes place inside or outside the boundary of the marketplace.''~\cite[p. 29]{ Nordhaus1999a}
 The data are used by states, local governments, businesses and investors alike to make sound economic decisions, the report emphasizes. 
Should the timber from an old growth forest be harvested?
 Using the data that are limited to income generating transactions only, the answer is yes. The harvesting of timber adds directly to national income. The value of the flow of ``hunting, fishing, and other forms of nonmarket forest recreation'' 
services foregone that likely outweighs the value of the harvested timber is not available to be part of the decision.~\cite[p. 30]{ Nordhaus1999a}


Although the BEA is no longer expressly prohibited from producing environmental-economic accounts, the IEESA accounts are not likely to be resumed. If the BEA was not able to receive political backing to undertake environmental-economic accounting under President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore, and two democratically-controlled chambers of Congress, it is unlikely the BEA will attempt environmental-economic accounts again without a specific mandate from the administration. 

It is a rare nation that will voluntarily consume less today to save for future generations. However, a nation that has a balance sheet as well as an income statement can observe when it is consuming the future generations' productive capital to produce the current generation's income. This is information that business leaders and policy-makers would want to have. This book highlights the need for these data and provides a framework for using them in a way relevant for policy-makers.

In the ancient fable, six blind men observe six different parts of an elephant and draw different conclusions about what is in front of them. Similarly, scientists and economists observe different parts of the economy and draw strikingly different conclusions about the future. We contend that both the scientists and the economists need to take off their blinders and appreciate that capital in all forms\footnote{Natural, manufactured, human, social, and financial.} is necessary to generate the services an economy requires. These two perspectives must be brought together to understand the potential futures we are facing.
