\motto{Where there is no reliable accounting 
and therefore no competent knowledge
of the economic and ecological effects of our lives,
we cannot live lives that are economically
and ecologically responsible. 
It is futile to plead and protest and lobby 
in favor of public ecological responsibility while, 
in virtually every act of our private lives, 
we endorse and support an economic system 
that is by intention, 
and perhaps by necessity, 
ecologically irresponsible.~\emph{\cite[p.~26]{Berry1998}}

\abstract*{In this chapter we give our motivation for writing this book. 
We outline some of the models and subsequent metaphors 
that have been used to describe the economy---clockwork, 
machine, engine---and suggest a new metaphor---the 
metabolism of an organism.
We give an overview of Leontief input-output methods
and their extension to include energy and material inputs
and waste flows out of the economy.
We then propose a new input-output analysis method,
fitting to the new metaphor of the metabolic economy;
a dynamic accounting framework that includes accumulation of stocks
within economic sectors.}

\begin{quote}
by year 50 the cost of maintaining the capital stock has overwhelmed the income from resource extraction, so profits are no longer sufficient to keep investment ahead of depreciation. The operation quickly shuts down, as the capital stock declines. The last and most expensive of the resource stays in the ground; it doesnâ€™t pay to get it out~\cite[p.60]{Meadows2008}

%%%%%%	Transition		%%%%%%
\section{Material and energy transitions/transformations are impending}
\label{sec:transition}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Supply vs. demand		%%%%%%
\subsection{Supply scarcity relative to demand (inflows)}
\label{sec:scarcity}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Outflows exceed assimilation		%%%%%%
\subsection{Economies are exceeding assimilative capacity of biosphere (outflows)}
\label{sec:exceed}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Maintenance of capital	%%%%%%
\subsection{High levels of capital stock require significant maintenance flows (we're running in place)}
\label{sec:running_in_place}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Unfolding of transitions	%%%%%%
\subsection{How will transitions and transformations unfold?}
\label{sec:unfold}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Isolated machine metaphor	%%%%%%
\section{The isolated economy}
\label{sec:isolated_economy}
%%%%%%

The isolated machine metaphor for the economy tells us that structural transformations will occur smoothly. 
     The isolated machine metaphor leads to some incorrect assumptions:

%%%%%%	Economy not connected to biosphere	%%%%%%
\subsection{No connection between the economy and the biosphere}
\label{sec:no_connection}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Infinite resources	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Resources are always available}
\label{sec:infinite_resources}
%%%%%%

Resources are always available.  If a particular resource is becomes scarce, substitute.

%%%%%% Infinite waste		%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Infinite assimilative capacity for wastes}
\label{sec:infinite_waste}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Internal dynamics	%%%%%%
\subsection{Only internal dynamics affect the economy}
\label{sec:internal_dynamics}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Economic forces	%%%%%%
\subsection{Economic forces (through prices and the market mechanism) will smoothly guide transition processes to good and just outcomes}
\label{sec:economic_forces}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Machine endures	%%%%%%
\subsection{The machine can and will carry on}
\label{sec:machine_endures}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Destructive transformations	%%%%%%
\section{Transformations have been rocky to this point. (eg. 1973, 2008)}
\label{sec:transformations}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Wrong models	%%%%%%
\section{Perhaps our economic models are wrong}
\label{sec:wrong_models}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Wrong metaphors		%%%%%%
\section{Perhaps our metaphors are wrong}
\label{sec:wrong_metaphors}
%%%%%%

But, economic models are informed by metaphors. Perhaps our metaphors are wrong.

%%%%%%	Importance of metaphors		%%%%%%
\section{Importance of metaphors}

\label{sec:inputs}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Internal exchanges	%%%%%%
\subsection{Exchanges materials and information and dissipates energy internally}
\label{sec:internal_exchange}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Discharges wastes	%%%%%%
\subsection{Discharges wastes to the biosphere}
\label{sec:discharges_waste}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Accounts for scarcity	%%%%%%
\subsection{Accounts for effects of scarcity (non-linearly) in the face of low-substitutability (and uncertainty)}
\label{sec:accounts_for_scarcity}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Importance of energy	%%%%%%
\subsection{Places importance on energetic costs}
\label{sec:importance_of_energy}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Dynamics and structure	%%%%%%
\subsection{Able to address dynamics and structural transformations}
\label{sec:structure}

Able to describe energy embodied in capital stock of economic sectors.

%%%%%%	Vefifiable	%%%%%%
\subsection{Informs models that are verifiable against historical data}
\label{sec:verifiable}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Metabolic metaphor %%%%%%
\section{The metabolic economy **** I"M GUESSING THIS MAY CHANGE TO e.g. ORGANISM - MCD ****}
\label{sec:metabolism}
%%%%%%

Perhaps a better metaphor for the economy is a metabolism (Greek root means "change"). 
     Metabolisms have the characteristics to meet the requirements outlined in 7 above.


%%%%%%	Analytic tools	%%%%%%
\section{Analytic tools}
\label{sec:analytic_tools}
%%%%%%

How can we fill in the metabolism metaphor? What "ideas ... are lying around"?
What analytical tools and data are at our disposal?
(Each sub-point below ties to the same sub-points in Item 7 above.)

%%%%%%	MFA	%%%%%%
\subsection{Material flow analysis (MFA)}
\label{sec:MFA}
%%%%%%

MFA, EW-MFA: Stresses the importance of material intake

%%%%%%	I-O	%%%%%%
\subsection{Input-Output (I-O) method}
\label{sec:I-O}
%%%%%%

I-O method: Highlights importance of internal exchanges

%%%%%%	LCA	%%%%%%
\subsection{Life cycle analysis (LCA)}
\label{sec:LCA}
%%%%%%

LCA, EIOLCA: Focuses attention on otherwise-neglected wastes

%%%%%%	NEA	%%%%%%
\subsection{Net energy analysis}
\label{sec:NEA}
%%%%%%

EROI: Predicts that energy resource scarcity reduces EROI and increases prices

%%%%%%	EI-O method		%%%%%%
\subsection{Energy Input-Output (EI-O) method}
\label{sec:EI-O}
%%%%%%

EI-O method: gives prominence to energetic costs for all internal flows

%%%%%%	CV modeling		%%%%%%
\subsection{Thermodynamic control volume (CV) modeling}
\label{sec:CV_modeling}
%%%%%%

Thermodynamic control volume modeling: captures transient behavior 
and transformations.  
Provides "accounting" equations.

%%%%%%	National Accounts	%%%%%%
\subsection{System of National Accounts}
\label{sec:national_accounts}
%%%%%%

System of National Accounts: provides data for analysis and verification purposes.  
Needs to be expanded.

%%%%%%	Importance of economic structure	%%%%%%
\section{Importance of economic structure}
\label{sec:structure}
%%%%%%

Each of the methods above (9.a.-9.e.) helps create snapshots of flows.  
None (except 9.f.) provides structural information.  
In other words, 9.a.-9.e. talk about the blood, not the bones. 
We need to understand flows (blood) and structure (stocks, bones). 
9.f. helps with that.

%%%%%%	Objective		%%%%%%
\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}
%%%%%%

Objective for the book: 
To develop a dynamic model that has the potential to describe structural transformations of the economy. 

%%%%%%	Approach		%%%%%%
\section{Methodological approach}
\label{sec:approach}
%%%%%%

Our approach to developing a dynamic model: 
Apply 9.f. to economies, informed by both 9.a-9.e and the metabolic metaphor, 
in manner that is verifiable against the existing (or expanded) System of National Accounts (9.g.).

%%%%%%	Outline		%%%%%%
\section{Outline of book}
\label{sec:outline}
%%%%%%

Where and how should we apply 9.f. to develop our dynamic model? 
What accounting must be done well to understand the dynamics of economies?
     a.    Materials (Chapter 2)
     b.    Energy (Chapter 3)
     c.    Embodied energy (Chapter 4)
     d.    Economic value (already done very well by the System of National Accounts, Chapter 5)
     e.    Key metrics that arise from this dynamic model: energy intensity and EROI (Chapter 6)


The list in 13 above provides the outline for the center of the book.  The rest of the outline is:

Implications from the dynamic model (Chapter 7) Unfinished business (Chapter 8) Summary (Chapter 9)
