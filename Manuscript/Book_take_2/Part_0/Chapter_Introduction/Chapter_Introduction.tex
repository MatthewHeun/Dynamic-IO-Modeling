In this chapter we give our motivation for writing this book. 
We outline some of the models and subsequent metaphors 
that have been used to describe the economy---clockwork, 
machine, engine---and suggest a new metaphor---the 
metabolism of an organism.
We give an overview of Leontief input-output methods
and their extension to include energy and material inputs
and waste flows out of the economy.
We then propose a new input-output analysis method,
fitting to the new metaphor of the metabolic economy;
a dynamic accounting framework that includes accumulation of stocks
within economic sectors.}

This book is primarily about accounting and change.
It is borne out of a belief that our economies are in constant flux;
changing dynamically in the short-term with human behavior
and evolving over longer time frames 
in response to changes in 
the technological and environmental landscape.
Much like any other real-world system, 
economies are messy and chaotic;
they do not march orderly from one state to the next.
**** MCD - I feel like we need another statement here ****
Maybe this one? ****
We must account for this dynamic nature if we are to
manage our economies more effectively.

This is also a book about metaphors and models.
We use metaphors to simplify and make sense of the world around us.
They influence us as stories we tell to convey meaning;
to teach ourselves and those around us about our world.
These metaphors also inform 
the mental and empirical models we construct.
And, as we collect data (via accounting methods) 
to assess the validity of those models,
our perception of the world is molded and shaped
by our accounting;
the very accounting which was initially informed
by the stories we told ourselves about reality.
Our models tell us what aspects of the world
are important to value 
(in the literal sense of making measurements),
and also, by extension, 
which parts of the world (literally) have no value.
This process has a deeper normative consequence: 
the aspects of the world to which our models ascribe
value become \emph{valuable},
and those ascribed no value become \emph{worthless}.

**** NEED A CLOSING STATEMENT HERE ****
It is our belief that traditional models of the economy
are based on metaphors that
do not ascribe sufficient value 
to important drivers of economic change.
This book is an attempt to redress that valuation.


%%%%%%%%%% Limits %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Limits: Extraction, substitution, and assimilation}
\label{sec:limits}
%%%%%%%%%%

Systems of National Accounts, 
particularly  in the U.S., 
were established to measure the things that 
our economic models valued most: 
physical production and consumption. 
However, our national accounting systems focus on income, 
not its underlying cause; a nation's wealth.
This means that we are not accounting for natural assets, 
not even the important categories of materials and energy,
in a way that can inform meaningful economic discussion or
lead to enlightened natural resource and energy policies.
Whether you think this is a problem depends, in part, on:
whether you think the world's economies are approaching 
	natural resource extraction limits;
whether you think the materials and energy upon which our economies currently depend
	can be easily substituted by other, readily-available, inexpensive resources; and
whether you think that the world's economies have exceeded 
	the biosphere's waste assimilation capacity.

Schnaiberg (1980)~\cite{schnaiberg1980}  introduced the concept of 
the ``treadmill of production'' to describe the systemic process of
increasing capital investment inherent in capitalist society
leading to ``higher and higher levels of demand for natural resources 
for a given level of social welfare''.\cite[p.297]{Gould2004}\footnote{
The logic of the treadmill is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item more capital is  becoming accumulated in Western economies, and 
	\item this capital is being applied to replace production labor 
				with new technologies to increase profits; 
	\item these new technologies require far more energy and/or chemicals 
				to replace previous, labor-intensive processes;
	\item new technologies emerge from the organization of scientific and 
				technological research in universities and research institutes, 
				as well as in the new ``research and development'' departments of large firms;
	\item moreover, unlike the prior use of labor, 
				the new technologies represent forms of sunk capital;
	\item to further increase profits, managers of firms need 
				to increase the levels of production 
				and sustain production at higher levels (because worker inputs can more readily be cut back 
				as opposed to fixed costs of machine operations).\cite[p.296]{Gould2004}
\end{enumerate}
}
**** MCD - not sure this is needed here
****
\begin{quote}
	Each round of investment weakened the employment situation 
	for production workers and worsened environmental conditions, 
	but it increased profits. 
	For workers, this treadmill implied that increasing investment 
	was needed to employ each production worker. 
	For ecosystems, each level of resource extraction became 
	commodified into new profits and new investments, 
	which led to still more rapid increases in demand 
	for ecosystem elements.~\cite[p.296]{Gould2004}
\end{quote}
****
The treadmill of production is evident today, 
driving up demand for many commodities.
Economic theory predicts that as demand for a product, such as oil, increases,
the increased profitability of rising prices 
will induce current producers to increase supply, 
additional producers to enter the market,
or other producers to offer close substitutes. 
In the case of natural resources, if that does not happen
then there is evidence that resource extraction limits are being reached.
This is true in the case of oil.
For much of the twentieth century, the price of oil remained below \$20 per barrel.
However, in the 2001--2008 timeframe,
the inflation-adjusted price of oil increased 260\%,
from around \$35 to a peak of \$126 per barrel 
(in constant 2010 USD).
During the same period,
world oil production rose from 
78~million barrels per day to 86~million barrels per day,
an increase of only 10\%.\cite{EIA2014}
Since 2010, the price of oil has remained over \$80 per barrel,
suggesting that production cannot increase quickly enough to bring prices
back down to historical levels.
Persistently high prices for such an important commodity
suggest very real limits to production; 
that supply is constrained relative to demand. 
We are reaching natural resource extraction limits.

On a physical basis, 
it is evident that easier-to-reach resources are extracted first. 
After the easier-to-reach resources are depleted (such as oil in West Texas),
more difficult-to-extract resources must be exploited,
further offshore,
in harsher environments, and
with enhanced techniques 
(such as steam flooding or hydraulic fracturing).
Sometimes, new, energy-intensive techniques are required 
for difficult deposits, such as oil sands.
Turning to materials extraction, the production of finer-grade ores
requires the processing of greater amounts of raw material, 
resulting in increasing mining tailings.\footnote{Mining tailings,
	are the unwanted materials that remain after mining processes
	have removed economically valuable materials.~\cite{Mudd2007}
	}
The processing of extra raw material takes more energy, and 
the energetic cost of extracting many materials is certainly increasing.\cite{Hall1986, Mudd2010, Hall2011}
This process has been labeled the ``Red Queen'' effect, 
where we must extract increasingly more resources to achieve the same
level of production---run faster and faster just to stay in 
the same place.\cite{Lees1975, Ross1988, Murray2013, Murphy2014}
The facts that (a) producers continue to reach deeper and farther 
and (b) energetic costs of production continue to rise
are further evidence that the world is reaching natural resource extraction limits.

For many commodities in today's market
supply is scarce relative to demand, 
with oil providing, arguably, the most important example. 
Both economic and physical realities indicate that the world is facing
natural resource extraction limits.

%+++++++++ Substituion ++++++++++
\subsection{Substitutability of natural resources}
%+++++++++



The ability to substitute human-made capital for natural resources
or one natural resource for another 
may alleviate the problem of natural resource scarcity relative to demand,
at least temporarily.
There are many historical cases of this sort of substitution occurring,
particularly in the energy sector.
%Biomass, mostly wood,
%formed the energetic foundation of pre-industrial society.
Deforestation within Europe,
primarily for fuel to smelt iron,~\cite{Smil1994}
prompted the switch from wood to coal.
Whale oil was replaced by petroleum-based kerosene for lighting and
coal has also been replaced by oil for other uses, 
especially transportation.~\cite{Weissenbacher2009}
More recently, natural gas has begun to replace oil in many applications.
Therefore, goes the argument, 
substitution may continually stave off resource scarcity.
But, there is evidence both at the macroeconomic level and 
at a technical level that there are limits to energy substitution.

A study of 21 countries 
found that clean and dirty 
****MCD - not sure what this means ****
inputs to energy production
are complementary (as opposed to substitutable).~\cite{Pelli:2012wv}
His conclusion is dire:

\begin{quote}
	On the one hand, according to the model, 
	if we keep producing electricity using dirty inputs, 
	we head toward an environmental disaster. 
	On the other hand, looking at the empirical results, 
	it seems impossible to stop producing electricity with polluting resources. 
	The policy implication of this paper thus, 
	seems to be that we need more important subsidies to research, 
	as fast as possible, 
	and high carbon taxes combined with a complete halt 
	of the growth rate of the production of electricity. 
	In this way, according to the model, 
	we may be able to avoid an environmental disaster.\cite[p.~25]{Pelli:2012wv}
\end{quote}

In a meta-analysis of 15 papers that studied 
the economic evidence for macro-substitutability
among factors of production (materials, capital, labor, and energy), 
de Wit et.\ al.\ \cite{de-Wit:2013aa} found that the elasticity of substitution was 
below unity for all combinations of factors of production.
Furthermore, they argue that, 

\begin{quote}
	[because all of the] results show elasticity of substitution below unity, 
	none of the factor inputs are perfectly substitutable and 
	all tend toward complementarity in varying degrees. 
	Such results suggest that transitions 
	from one production or consumption structure to another 
	can be disruptive and that the transitions 
	need to be modeled dynamically to the extent possible.\cite[p.~8]{de-Wit:2013aa}
\end{quote}

There are limits to substitution from a technical point of view, as well.
Within tightly coupled, complex systems
changes in one part of the system may have unintended consequences elsewhere.
For example, there are no known substitutes for oil 
in many sectors of the economy.\cite{Hirsch2005}
Bio-fuels were hailed by many as a viable alternative,
but there is not enough land for bio-fuels to meet current demand
without displacing food production.
The U.S.\ obtains 13 billion gallons of bio-ethanol 
(less than 10\% of the 134 billion gallons of domestic fuel consumption in 2012)
by diverting approximately 40\%
of domestic corn production.\cite{EIA2014, USDA2014}
This policy has had dramatic impacts on global food security,
with each billion gallon increase in production believed to cause
a 2-3\$ increase in corn prices.~\cite{Kemick2013}

Often, the substitution of man-made resources for natural resources
requires the use of greater amounts of energy.
For example, the production of fresh water from recycled or sea-water
can be particularly energy intensive.
Thus the substitution of one natural resource (fresh water)
for a manufactured resource (desalinated water)
required greater inputs of natural resources (free energy) to achieve.
Whereas material resources can, at least in theory,
be recycled indefinitely,
free energy is the ultimate limiting resource, 
because energy cannot be 100\% recycled

\subsection{Overloading the biosphere's assimilative capacity}
%+++++++++

**** Mik: This section needs another thorough review. 
I've rearranged things quite a bit, and I may have 
changed your original intent in some places. MKH ****

There are many examples of society locally exceeding 
the assimilation capacity of the biosphere.
In 1952, London city experienced a lethal smog cloud,
due to coal-burning power stations,
that, according to some, 
claimed up to 12,000 lives.\cite{Davis2002,Bell2004}
Many Chinese cities are currently experiencing similar problems.

Such point-source, localized environmental problems can often be overcome.
In Britain, two Clean Air Acts regulated emissions from both
industrial and domestic sources.~\cite{Brimblecombe2006}	
However, many pollutants, such as air pollution, 
are either emitted from multiple locations or have 
significant non-local effects. 
Such pollution includes:
algal blooms and so-called ``dead zones'' due to over-use of agricultural fertilizers;
over-use of agricultural pesticides;
build-up of persistent organic pollutants, especially endocrine disruptors, such as PCBs 
and BPAs;\footnote{Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is a synthetic organic chemical often used as 
	a dielectric or coolant in electrical equipment, which is a know carcinogen.
	Bisphenol (BP) A is a carbon-based synthetic compound used in the production
	of plastics and epoxy resins. It exhibits hormone-like properties at high doses.
	}
bio-accumulation of heavy metals released due to mineral extraction and industrial processing;
ozone depletion due to release of chlorinated gases (primarily halocarbons);
acid rain due to release of sulfur dioxides;
release of radioactive materials;
detergents in sewage;
invasive species;
oil spills;
and, of course, greenhouse gas emissions.\cite{Butler1978, UNMEA2005, Walker2012}

There is mounting evidence that systemic
damage occurs due to the externalized costs
of increasing production.
The perspective of \emph{external} and \emph{internal} is subjective.
A cost externalized by one agent
must be internalized by another.~\cite{MEA2005,Ewing2008}
%	To other members of society,
%	those costs can be very personal.
Often it is natural systems that must bear the cost of human production.
So-called ``free'' natural resources are exploited,
land-use is altered to better suit society's needs,
and other species are marginalized by the encroach of human activity.\cite{Schnaiberg1980}
In many cases, as more waste is deposited into ecosystems,
and as the structures of ecosystems is permanently altered to human ends,
the assimilation capacity of the biosphere declines.
When the assimilation capacity of the biosphere is exceeded, 
services provided by the biosphere may be disrupted.\cite{UNMEA2005}


%Logic of the treadmill:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{increasing accumulation of wealth, through ownership of economic organizations that successfully
%				use ecological resources to expand production and profits;}
%	\item{increasing movement of workers from self-employment, into positions of employees

%	\item{increasing allocations of the accumulated wealth to newer technologies
%				in order to replace labor with physical capital,
%				thereby generating more profits for wealth-holders,
%				in order to sustain and expand their ownership in the face of
%				growing competition from other wealth-holders;}
%	\item{increasing activities of governments to facilitate expanded 
%				accumulation of wealth for ``national development,''
%				on the one hand, and ``social security,''
%				on the other;}
%	\item{the net result of these processes is an increasing necessity for ever greater
%				ecological withdrawals and additions in order to sustain a given level of

%	\item{the ecological obverse of point 5. is the increasing likelihood of an

%+++++++++ Material and energy transformation ++++++++++
\section{Material and energy transformation}
%+++++++++

Because the world is facing natural resource extraction limits
(especially for some forms of energy)
and because we are exceeding the assimilative capacity of the biosphere,
it follows that a structural transformation of the economy is imminent
to change our future use of materials and energy.
Society cannot accelerate rates of material extraction
and waste production indefinitely.
%New materials and energy resources will be necessary.

Because substitutability is less than infinite, 
it follows that reaching the extraction and assimilation limits 
of the biosphere will bring significant challenges.
The question is: how will this transformation unfold?
How will our economies cope with the challenges?
This transformation will either  
\emph{happen to} us, or we will \emph{plan for} it.
At present,
this transition is happening \emph{to} us:
very little materials or energy planning occurs
at the industry-wide or government level.
On the world stage, notable exceptions include the UN Environment Programme's 
International Resource Panel~\cite{UNEP-IRP:aa}
and the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.\cite{UNSEEA:aa}
Because it is likely that unplanned transformations will be rocky and difficult,
we believe that some type of planning is needed.

Clearly, the first step for effective planning 
is knowledge of the current state of affairs.
%where things stand today.
We need to know the existing materials and energy structure of our economies. 
This implies that we should know the rates at which 
the world's economies consume raw materials and emit wastes back to the biosphere.
We need to understand the connections between the biosphere and the economies of the world.
In short, we need to be \emph{accounting for the environment}!\footnote{The title 
	of this book is a \emph{triple entendre}.
	First, we should take the environment ``into \emph{account}''
		when developing our system of national accounts.
		As discussed in the Prologue, at present, we are not.
	Second, we should be maintaining and disseminating
		records or accounts of environmental assets. 
		In this usage, \emph{account} is a noun
		referring to our endowment of natural resources.
	Third, we should develop our system of national accounts 
		\emph{for the benefit of} the environment, 
		with the understanding 
		that a healthy environment sustains a healthy economy.
		In this sense, \emph{accounting} is used as a verb with a telos.}

But, we also need to know how materials and energy consumption 
are likely to evolve in the future.
We should know where and at what rate 
materials and embodied energy accumulate 
in economic infrastructure. 
We should know the material and energy costs for maintaining the
increasingly-complex infrastructure of society.
We should have a sense of the transient and variable nature of economies
and the materials and energy flows that sustain them.

Despite this need, we (i.e., society at large) 
are not accounting in a way that helps us plan 
for the economic challenges that will accompany 
the impending materials and energy transformation.
All of which leads to a burning question,
one with significant consequences for the future:

\begin{quote}
{\normalsize{How can you maintain a system of national accounts without 
accounting for natural assets?}}
\end{quote}

\noindent{}With that in mind, the purpose of this book is to 
develop a dynamic model to help us
``account for the environment''
with the objective of planning for impending materials and energy transformations.

%%%%%%%%%% Metaphors and Models %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Metaphors and models}
\label{sec:metaphors_and_models}
%%%%%%%%%%

Before moving ahead with the work of developing our dynamic model,
it is useful to consider how society has come to this point.
How is it that we don't account for the environment when 
considering materials and energy flows into, within, and out of the economy?
The classical economists certainly appreciated the dependence of
economic activity on bio-physical processes.\cite{Cleveland1987, Hall2011, Dale2012}
However, somewhere between William Stanley Jevons' 1865
assessment that
coal production was driving ``the very existence of Britain, as a great nation''~\cite[IV.3]{Jevons1865}
*** BRH isn't this quote supposed to indicate that running out of coal from over production
and the recursive need for coal to produce more coal
was threatening GB? That quote doesn't seem to make that very clear ***
**** MCD - no, I simply wanted a statement from an eminent economist on the importance of natural resources.
It doesn't have to be from Jevons and I'm certainly open to a different quote ****
and Julian Simon's 1998 statement that
``natural resources are not finite in any economic sense,''~\cite[p.~54]{Simon1998} %chktex 38
the importance of the biosphere was lost.


%+++++++++ The clockwork meatphor ++++++++++
\subsection{The clockwork metaphor}
\label{sec:clockwork_metaphor}
%+++++++++

Indeed, most economics textbooks today depict the economy 
as in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}.
Goods and services flow from the production sector
to the household sector~(consumption)
in exchange for payments.
The factors of production (labor and capital)
flow from the household sector to the
production sector in exchange for wages and rents.
Attention is primarily focused on the circular flow
of money~(dashed line).


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_1.pdf}
\caption[The traditional economic model of the economy]{The economy 
is represented as a circular flow of goods and services between two sectors. 
The producers manufacture goods and services 
by taking in labor and capital. 
Consumers exchange labor for wages 
which are used to purchase 
the goods and services of the producers.}
\label{fig:perp_motion_1}
\end{figure}

This traditional model of the economy is unashamedly mechanistic.
General equilibrium models of the economy~\cite{Walras1892, Walras1993}
borrowed directly from classical physics' models of 
mechanical equilibrium based on the metaphor of a ``clockwork universe.''\cite{Ingrao1990}
The traditional model of the economy depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} 
is informed by the clockwork metaphor.
As discussed above, 
the clockwork metaphor is an example  
of a simplification that helps us make sense of the world around us.
Metaphors inform our thinking about the real world,
but consequently,
they also constrain our ability to frame reality.
We mistake the model-metaphor for reality, and
we interact with reality in the same manner 
as we interact with the abstract objects of our
models.\footnote{This fallacious process is called
	\emph{reification}; the making (\emph{facere}, Latin) real of
	something (\emph{res}, Latin) that is merely an idea.
	Alfred Whitehead refers to this as
	\emph{the fallacy of misplaced concreteness}.\cite{Whitehead2011}}
Classical physics told us the universe is
\emph{like} clockwork, 
so we began to interact with the universe
as if it \emph{really were} clockwork.
It then became easy to collect data that confirmed the clockwork model,
because the model told us which data to collect.

The clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy
preclude any sort of connection 
between the economy and the biosphere.
Thus, only the internal dynamics of the economy are important. 
They tell us that natural resources are unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere will always provide.
If a particular resource becomes scarce, 
substitution to a different, more-readily-available resource will be made.
They tell us that wastes are quantitatively unimportant, 
effectively assuming that the biosphere has infinite assimilative capacity.
Finally, the clockwork metaphor and traditional model of the economy 
tell us that economic forces 
(through prices and the market mechanism) 
are sufficient to efficiently guide any necessary transition
within the economy.
Any physical constraints that the biosphere places on 
the allocation of resources, distribution of outputs, and 
scale of an economy 
are outside the scope of neoclassical economic discussion.\cite{Daly1995}
%``Natural resources are not finite in any economic sense.''~\cite[p.~54]{Simon1998} %chktex 38
In short, the clockwork metaphor and the traditional model of the economy 
tell us that the economic machine can and will carry on.

Because Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} has no flow of energy
into the economy,
we may consider it a perpetual motion machine
of the \emph{first kind}:
the economy works without the input of energy, thus violating
the First Law of Thermodynamics---the 
law of conservation of energy.\cite{Rao2004}
However, thermodynamics tells us that all physical processes 
require a transfer of energy.

%another resource (coal) for it.
%Substitution may continue indefinitely thus, so
%goes the story,
%the only limiting resource is
%human ingenuity.\cite{Simon1981, Simon1998}
%
%This assumption was thrown into stark relief following the oil
%shocks of the Seventies.
%Suddenly the global economy was thrown
%into reverse for lack of one fundamental resource.
%The necessity of including,
%at the very least,
%energy resources into the economic picture
%spurred the efforts of early (net) energy 
%analysts.\cite{Gilliland1975, Chapman1976}


The limits of the clockwork metaphor and traditional model of the economy were 
exposed by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
Suddenly the global economy
``stalled'' due to lack of 
% was thrown into reverse by 
a single, highly-constrained resource:
fuel.
Many came to realize that energy input is required
for successful operation of an economic ``engine''.
Thus, a machine metaphor and 
accompanying engine model for the economy 
rose to prominence
in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The need to include energy resources
in the economic picture
spurred the efforts of early (net) energy 
analysts.\cite{Gilliland1975, Chapman1976}

The engine model accounts for energy flows from the biosphere 
to the economy and is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}.
The economy changed from 
the \emph{isolated} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1}) into 
an \emph{closed} system~(Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}). 
The importance of input energy is acknowledged, 
but wastes are absent.
And, the biosphere is relegated to the position
of provider of resources;
the gas station of the economy.\cite{Norgaard2010}

analysis has included the flows into the economy from the environment.

\end{figure}

The machine metaphor and engine model are still very much mechanistic.
Much like the engines of the Industrial Revolution,
the economic engine is assumed to be well-behaved and amenable to control.
Machine metaphors abound even today in our economic discussions.
We speak of ``fueling'' the ``economic engine'' 
lest it should ``stall.''~\cite{Liu2012}
Like a well-running engine, the economy is assumed 
to be resilient to small or even quite large perturbations.  
It can either self-correct, 
or be corrected with adjustments to
a few predictable policy levers.
**** MCD - Need closing statement here. Maybe this one? ****
But how accurate is this point of view?


%%%%%%%%%% A new metaphor %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A new metaphor}
\label{sec:new_metaphor}
%%%%%%%%%% 

When our collective imagination is stuck on a metaphor that 
informs models in which the economy is isolated from the biosphere,
the suggestion to ``account for the environment'' is unconvincing, and 
the challenges cited earlier (natural resource extraction limits,
difficulty of material and energy substitutions, and 
exceeding the biosphere's waste assimilation capacity)
seem unimportant. 

But, mounting evidence shows otherwise. 

Thus, we need to find a new way to understand the complex, 
messy dynamics of real-world economies;
we need a new way to make sense of real-world events;
we need a new way to learn where and how economies can go wrong; and
we need to plan for the impending materials and energy transformations.
To do so, we had better be counting data that informs \emph{dynamic} models
guided by metaphors that tell us \emph{more} than ``the world is an orderly place.''
Our counting needs to be informed by metaphors and models that are
able to cope with rapid transience and transformation,
not just ordered stability.

We need a new metaphor.


%%%%%%%%%% An Apt Metaphor %%%%%%%%%%
\section{An apt metaphor for the economy}
\label{sec:apt_metaphor}
%%%%%%%%%%

If the clockwork and machine metaphors are unsuitable, 
what might an apt metaphor for the economy be?
And, if we find an apt metaphor, what types of models would it inform?
Furthermore, what data would the models tell us to collect?
That is, how should we account for the environment?

To begin the search for an apt metaphor, 
we might first ask the question, 
what characteristics should the metaphor possess?
In our opinion, an apt metaphor should account for the facts 
that a real economy:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{intakes material and energy from the biosphere}
	\item{exchanges materials, energy, and information internally}
	\item{discharges material and energy wastes to the biosphere}
	\item{is affected by energetic costs}
	\item{is affected non-linearly by scarcity in the face of low substitutibility}
	\item{can change in discrete, non-linear fashion with the potential 
			for structural transformation}
	\item{embodies energy in material stocks, and}
	\item{maintains organizational structure despite changes 
			in the environment.\footnote{We note that 
			several areas of the literature speak to the items in this list.
			Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and 
			Economy-Wide Material Flow Analys (EW-MFA)
			stress the importance of
			material intake by the economy. 
			(See Section~\ref{sec:materials_auto}.)
			The Input-Output (I-O) method highlights the effects of internal exchanges
			of material and information with economies. 
			(See Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.)
			Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) techniques focus attention 
			on otherwise-neglected wastes. 
			(See Section~\ref{sec:intensity_auto}.)
			Net Energy Analysis (NEA) predicts that energy resource 
			scarcity reduces Energy Return on Investment (EROI)
			and increases energy prices.
			(See Sections~\ref{sec:B_energy} 
			and~\ref{sec:resource_quality_and_irreversibility}.)
			The Energy Input-Output (EI-O) method gives prominence to energetic costs
			for internal material and energy flows.
			(See Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.)
			And, thermodynamic control-volume modeling describes
			transient behavior and system transformations.
			(See Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value}.)
			}}
\end{enumerate}
%*** BRH thinks the footnote should end at this spot and the rest is unnecessary, or is confusing because metabolism hasn't been introduced yet. *** However, MFA, EW-MFA, I-O, EI-O, LCA, and NEA create snapshots 
%			of flows within economies. 
%			None of the techniques above (except thermodynamic control-volume modeling) 
%			provides structural information. 
%			In other words, most of these methods talk about blood, not bones. 
%			We contend later (see Section~\ref{sec:apt_models}) that both flows (blood) 
%			and structure (stocks, bones) need to be understood.
%			Thermodynamic control-volume modeling provides the capability 
%			to understand both flows and stocks.}}
%

Living metabolisms\footnote{The 
	Greek root of metabolism 
	(\emph{metabol$\bar{e}$}) means ``change.''}
exhibit the characteristics in the list above.
Metabolisms and the organisms they support
are intimately connected with the biosphere:
they withdraw materials and energy from the biosphere~(1), 
transfer materials and energy internally via metabolic processes~(2), 
and discharge wastes back to the biosphere~(3);
in fact, their very survival depends on these processes.
Metabolisms are affected by energetic costs~(4): 
an organism that obtains less energy than it expends is doomed.
Metabolisms exist in a state of dynamic stability~(5),
adjusting and readjusting to maintain their internal conditions
despite changes in the environment; 
for a metabolism, equilibrium means death!
Metabolisms enable non-linear, structural transformations
in their host organisms (e.g., metamorphosis, puberty, and evolution)~(6).
And, energy absorbed into a metabolism is considered to be ``embodied''
in the cells of the organism~(7).
Extending Figures~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} and~\ref{fig:perp_motion_2}
to include the facts in items~(1)--(3) above, 
we obtain Figure~\ref{fig:metabolic_economy}.

The economy is society's metabolism.\cite{F-K1998, Giampietro2000, Giampietro2013}

%%%%%%%%%% Apt Models %%%%%%%%%%
\section{An apt material, energy, and economy model}
\label{sec:apt_models}
%%%%%%%%%%

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:metaphors_and_models}, 
metaphors give rise to models.
So, a natural question is: 
``what types of models does the metabolism metaphor inform?''

In our opinion, apt models should have the following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{account for flows of materials and energy into, within, and out of the economy,}
	\item{account for accumulation of materials and energy within the economy,}
	\item{provide metrics that relate energy demands and economic value, and}
	\item{provide results that are comparable against existing 
			(or expanded) systems of national accounts.}
\end{enumerate}

*** BRH thinks this paragraph needs to be made more reader friendly. Will make an attempt during my next 
editing around if needed. *** 
%Transient conservation 
Material and energy flow balance equations, 
often employed by thermodynamicists, 
can account for both flows~(1) and accumulation~(2) of materials
and energy within systems.
We will adapt an existing input-output~(I-O),
energy analysis method to develop a 
technique for obtaining metrics of energy and economic value~(3).
Finally, we note that systems of national accounts use the economic sector
as their level of analysis. 
Thus, our models should be also implemented at the economic sector level
so that results from the models we develop can be 
compared against existing (or expanded) systems of national accounts~(4).


%%%%%%%%%% What to Count %%%%%%%%%%
\section{What to count?}
\label{sec:what_to_count}
%%%%%%%%%%
*** BRH thinks this section would be made stronger with 
some example questions that can't be answered without our model ***
**** MCD - good point. We should discuss this at next meeting ****
We contend that society is not accounting materials and energy adequately 
in order to plan for the coming material and energy transformations.
After settling on the metabolism metaphor for the economy, 
and after deciding to employ transient thermodynamic equations to develop our model, 
are we any further ahead?
More importantly, will this model allow consumers, producers,
and policy-makers to answer critical questions that are not
answerable today? 
We think so, as we shall endeavor to demonstrate in the remainder of this book.
We believe the key to understanding how energy transformations will unfold
involves specifically understanding how

\begin{itemize}
	\item{materials,}
	\item{energy,}
	\item{embodied energy, and}
	\item{economic value}
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}each flow and accumulate within society's metabolism, the economy.
Of course, each of the above items interacts with the others 
and the biosphere dynamically.
If we can begin to carefully track these items, 
we will be on our way to gathering the information required to 
assist planning for upcoming materials and energy transformations.

To summarize Sections~\ref{sec:apt_metaphor}--\ref{sec:what_to_count}, 
our approach is to:

****MCD - not sure which is preferable ****

%%%%%%%%%% Structure %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Structure of the book}
\label{sec:structure}
%%%%%%%%%%

The list in Section~\ref{sec:what_to_count} 
provides the beginning of the structure for the rest of this book.

Part~\ref{part:matter} addresses flows of physical matter and energy
through the economy.
Chapter~\ref{chap:materials} discusses material flows and accumulation.
Flows of energy are covered in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}, 
and a rigorous, thermodynamics-based definition of and accounting for 
embodied energy is presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.
Throughout the methodological chapters~(\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value}),
our accounting framework is developed
through a series of increasingly-disaggregated
models of the economy~(Table~\ref{tab:examplesABC}).

In Part~\ref{part:values} we turn to flow and accumulation of 
non-physical entities through the economy. 
Flows and accumulation of economic value are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:value}.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity} we combine the results from 
Chapters~\ref{chap:embodied_energy} and~\ref{chap:value} to
calculate an important indicator of economic activity:
the energy intensity of economic production.

Part~\ref{part:implications} gives context to the framework developed in
Parts~\ref{part:matter}~and~\ref{part:values}.
Chapter~\ref{chap:implications} draws out some of the direct implications
of our framework.
Chapter~\ref{chap:unfinished_business} looks at 
unfinished business: practical, conceptual, and theoretical issues
that arise in the development of this framework.
And, we end with a summary in Chapter~\ref{chap:summary}.

Throughout the book, we use the U.S. auto industry 
as a running example for application and discussion.
%
%**** Add more detail to justify the auto industry example. **** 
%
%**** Here are notes from previous email corresondence. ****
%
The running example of the US auto industry demonstrates that our dynamic model 
can be tied to the System of National Accounts, 
thereby meeting one of the requirements for a dynamic model. 
%Our purpose is not to update previous energy intensity calculations.
%
The US auto industry example shows where data are available 
(e.g., economic value, Chapter~\ref{chap:value}), 
where it is old (e.g., energy intensity, Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}), 
and where it has never been available 
(e.g., accumulated embodied energy, Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}).  
The US auto industry is, therefore, 
illustrative of the challenges inherent in obtaining data that would feed the model.

The auto industry has been used previously
in the literature in both 
process-based~\cite{Berry:1973vo, Sullivan1995, Stodolsky1995, 
							Sullivan1998, McCleese2002, Sullivan2010, Hawkins2012}
and Input-Output~\cite{Bullard:1978vd, MacLean1998, MacLean2003}
analysis methods,
Furthermore, the industry
remains a large portion of many industrialized economies, 
is very resource intensive, 
has obvious links with energy because
its health is sensitive to disruptions in energy supplies, and
the industry also shows evidence of 
post-industrial decline (shrinking profit margins, etc.).
