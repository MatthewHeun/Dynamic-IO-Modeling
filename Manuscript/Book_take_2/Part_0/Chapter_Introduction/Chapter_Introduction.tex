\section{Models-metaphors for the economy}

\subsection{Traditional mechanistic view of economy}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Traditional economic model based on `circular' flow of blood around the body. 
	Real circulation system is connected to lungs, which throughput O$_2$ and CO$_2$, 
	and also to the digestive and urinal tracts which thoughput food into waste---solid and liquid.}
\end{itemize}

Traditional economic flow accounting examines gross payments 
from the household sector to the production sector for goods and services, the flow of payments from the production sector 
to the household sector for wages and rents, and the reciprocal flows of goods \& services and factors of prodcution. Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} 
recreates the typical circular flow model represented in mainstream \emph{Principles of Economics} texts.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\label{fig:perp_motion_1}
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Perpetual_motion_1.pdf}
\caption[The traditional economic model of the economy]{The economy 
is represented as a circular flow of goods and services between two sectors. 
The producers manufacture goods and services 
by taking in labor and capital. 
Consumers exchange labor for wages 
which are used to purchase 
the goods and services of the producers.}
\end{figure}

Although the Biosphere is represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:perp_motion_1} 
here, it is rarely represented in mainstream texts. 
In neoclassical economics, 
the economy is implicitly and figuratively separate from the material world within which it operates.
The traditional economic model is presented as an \emph{isolated} system, 
independent from flows of materials and energy.
That is, the material resources, energy
and assimiliative capacity of the biosphere required to run the economy are outside the model.
The economy is presented as a ``perpetual motion machine,'' seemingly able to % chktex 38
operate indefinitely with no binding constraints.
Because these physical elements of the biosphere are absent from economic models,
the physical constraint they place on the allocation of resources, distribution of outputs, and 
scale of an economy are outside the scope of traditional economic discussion.

Now that the global economy is experiencing the pressure of these physical constraints, 
the necessity for a more comprehensive model, and collection of data to estimate it,
is emerging. Environmental Economics, as a sub-discipline, expands the traditional model to include material exchanges with the biosphere. 
However, even with this expanded model, the simplifying assumptions remain intact. The guiding metaphor for 
an economy is an engine. Like an engine, the economy is  assumed 
to be resilient to small and even quite large perturbations.  It can either self-correct, or be corrected with adjustments to
a few predictable policy levers. Predominantly linear relationships of inputs and outputs rule the day. 
Successful management of  local pollution, such as SO$_2$, through environmental legislation
is a positive result of this expanded model.
 

However, systemic events resulting from reinforcing feedback loops or from events occuring
outside historical experience cannot be modeled and are not predictable. The 2007 global 
financial crisis is an example of one such systemic event. **** BRH cite the economist article ***
The 1930's dust bowl is also a result of a systemic event. It was one of the greatest man-made
environmental disasters, arising from unexpected, non-linear 
results of widely accepted traditional farming practices, 
implemented in a new, and unknown ecosystem. ***BRH cite Lockertz 1978 ***


\subsection{Economic models that include resource inputs}
Ecological economists in the tradition of Herman Daly have begun to 
update the traditional models. In ecological economics texts, the economy is 
represented as a \emph{closed} system. The guiding metaphor for this kind of economic model is an \emph{organism}. Like an organism,
the economy metabolizes energy that it receives from the natural resources
 into forms usable for human purposes.

add in flows of ecosystems on the front and back end of the traditional model---and keep it a simple linear model. The usefulness
of using an ecological model is that in addition, it captures the systemic complexity of the economy as well. ****

\section{Brief history of input-output (I-O) modeling}

Input-output analysis, developed by Wassilly Leontief in the 1930s 
as an extension to the work of Quesnay and Walras~\cite{Leontief1936}, 
is of primary importance in national accounting, 
allowing determination of the structure of an economy as well as, 
among other things, 
calculation of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP), 
the predominant measure of economic activity.








\subsection{Basic I-O method}

The basic premise of the I-O method, 
as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:basic_unit}A, 
is that each economic sector takes in factors of production 
from other sectors (and possibly itself) 
to produce an economic good at some rate. 
For example, the automotive sector takes in steel, rubber, glass, etc. 
and produces a number of cars per year. 
In contrast to high-level economic growth models 
that include only a few factors of production (such as land, capital, and labor), 
the I-O analysis technique allows many differentiated factors of production 
and raw material feedstocks.\cite{Costanza:1980ww} 
In I-O frameworks, each factor of production 
is considered to be a output from a sector of the economy. 
As will be discussed later [MAKE SURE TO DISCUSS THIS LATER!], 
the traditional primary factors of production (land, capital, and labor) 
are not \emph{flows} into the production processes. 
Rather, they are \emph{stocks} that, when present, 
allow factors of production (steel, rubber, and glass) 
to be transformed into final products (automobiles). 
The quantity and quality of these stocks 
determine the quantity and quality of their flow of productive services.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Basic_unit_square.pdf}
\caption[The basic unit of input-output modeling]{The basic unit 
of input-output modeling: 
\textbf{A} the standard economic approach includes only transactions 
among sectors of the economy; 
\textbf{B} the ecological economics approach models inputs 
from the natural environment outside the economy as factors of production; 
\textbf{C} including waste flows to the environment makes the model physically consistent and;
\textbf{D} the method presented here accounts also for accumulation
in capital stock, $K$, of embodied energy within materials in economic sectors. 
[SHOULD WE HAVE THE LABEL ``K'' IN THE ACCUMULATION, OR JUST HAVE THE TANK?]}
\label{fig:basic_unit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{I-O method including inputs from the biosphere}

In addition to the productive services provided by stocks of land, capital, and labor,
a flow of energy\footnote{Or, more precisely, 
the degradation of an exergetic gradient/destruction of exergy.} 
is required for economic activity. 
These energy flows originate from the natural environment, 
recognition of which has provoked researchers from fields of 
net energy analysis (NEA), 
material flow analysis (MFA), 
industrial ecology (IE), and 
life-cycle assessment (LCA) 
to extend the traditional (Leontief) input-output framework 
to include important material and energy flows to and from the environment, 
as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:basic_unit}B.\cite{Carter1974,Bullard1975,Bullard1976a,Herendeen1978,Costanza:1980ww,Casler1984,Joshi:1999uw,Suh2009}
While the Leontief I-O approach relies exclusively 
on monetary units to represent value flows 
among sectors of an economy, 
the key insight of these extensions 
of the Leontief I-O framework is to rely upon physical units 
(especially energy units of joules) 
to represent some of the value flows among economic sectors. 
In doing so, energy and material intensities of value flows can be estimated. 
This extended approach is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:basic_unit}C. 

Both the original Leontief I-O framework 
and the extensions cited above 
assume steady-state conditions in an economy, 
i.e., flows of value and material into 
and out of each economic sector are in balance. 
Dynamic or transient behavior 
of the economic system is not considered. 
Thus, there is no accumulation of economic factors 
or embodied energy within any of the sectors. 
The analysis techniques provide ``snapshots'' 
of economic activity at an instant in time.

[MIK'S NEW ADDITION]

Assuming no accumulation of materials, 
within economic sectors or society itself, 
is tantamount to assuming that \emph{all} material flows 
through the economy are directed toward the production of non-durable goods. 
However, evidence of the durability of goods 
and the accumulation of materials surrounds us. 
Furthermore, energy was required to both fabricate and emplace 
the durable goods and infrastructure of modern economies. 
(The energy it took to create the durable goods and infrastructure 
can be considered ``embodied'' within the built environment, 
a point to which we will return in detail later). 
As Georgescu-Roegen notes, 
``in the everyday world one cannot possibly cross a river 
only on the flow of maintenance materials of a non-existent bridge.''\cite{G-R1975}

Analysis methods that neglect the accumulation 
of materials and embodied energy 
in the durable goods and infrastructure 
of the everyday world lack explanatory power. 
Such models can tell us at what rates materials and energy are required 
to \emph{use} our built environment. 
But, such models cannot tell us \emph{how} 
the built environment came to be 
(and how much energy was required to construct it) 
or \emph{why} flows of goods are needed. 
To use Georgescu-Roegen's imagery, 
models that neglect accumulation fail to explain 
why we need any material flows to maintain a non-existent bridge. 
Stocks of accumulated materials 
(capital, appliances, even people) 
are the drivers of demand. 
It is to service their needs and wants that we put the economy to work. 

Because economic activity requires energy, 
we need to understand the way energy flows through economies. 
The steady-state I-O techniques of Bullard, Herendeen, 
and others\cite{Bullard1975,Herendeen1978} 
offer a means to that end. 
We contend, however, that these techniques 
need to be extended and modified to include transient effects 
that arise when durability of goods and infrastructure 
(and associated embodied energy) are considered. 
This manuscript attempts to address that need.




%\section{Issues of resource quality}
%
%[DO WE NEED THIS SECTION? IT FEELS LIKE WE SHOULD MOVE FROM THE PREVIOUS SECTION WHEREIN WE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR OUR WORK TO BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE METHOD. IF WE WANT TO KEEP THIS SECTION, WE SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB AT SHOWING WHY IT IS NEEDED. WE SHOULD POINT BACK TO BULLARD AND HERENDEEN AND SAY THAT THEIR METHOD DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR DECREASING RESOURCE QUALITY AND WHY A METHOD IS NEEDED THAT DOES ACCOUNT FOR DECLINING RESOURCE QUALITY. --MKH] 
% [MCD---I'm going to steal this paragraph for the Unfinished Business chapter.]
%Raw material and energy resources must first be extracted from the natural environment before they may be utilized in the economy to provide goods and service to society. Despite increasing levels of technological efficiency, for example in consumer goods such as refrigerators and cars, evidence shows that the energy intensity of primary resource extraction, i.e. the energy required to extract raw materials from the environment, has been steadily increasing over the last fifty years \cite{Hall1986, Mudd2010, Brandt2011}. This increasing energy requirement for primary extraction means that less \textit{net energy} is available for downstream uses. If this decline in net energy availability outpaces technological advances in energy efficiency, there may be deleterious impacts on the economic output of the economy.

\subsection{An I-O method for dynamic (transient) economic analysis}

In this manuscript, we develop a physical input-output, 
matrix-based method for modeling multi-sector economies, 
in the tradition of Georgescu-Roegen's ``flow-fund'' 
model.\cite{G-R1979a, G-R1979b} 
The method presented in this paper takes a decidedly engineering approach
**** Need to re-cast in metabolism language!!!! **** 
to extend the techniques of Bullard, Herendeen, and others 
to account for durability of goods and embodied energy. 
This method allows us to see how energy and materials flow through the economy, 
where embodied energy accumulates in the economy, 
and how declining resource quality may affect these dynamics. 
[NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ACHIEVE THIS LAST POINT]

\section{Organization of this book}

The remainder of this book is organized as follows. 
Chapter~\ref{chap:materials} presents a discussion of material flows through economies.
Flows of direct energy are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}, 
and a rigorous, thermodynamics-based definition of and accounting for 
embodied energy is presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}. 
Flows of economic value and the energy intensity of economic output are
discussed in Chapters~\ref{chap:value}~and~\ref{chap:intensity}, respectively.
Chapter~\ref{chap:implications} draws some implications 
from the framework for economic growth and other important topics.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:unfinished_business} looks at 
unfinished business: practical, conceptual, and theoretical issues
that arise in the development of this framework.

In Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:intensity},
we develop our dynamic framework for materials and energy accounting
through a series of increasingly-disaggregated
models of the economy (Table~\ref{tab:examplesABC}). 
In addition, we use the the US auto industry 
as a running example for application and discussion.

%%\paragraph{Paragraph Heading} %
%% Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

%% Note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

%% When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
