\abstract*{**** Re-write the abstract. ****
In this chapter we give our motivation for writing this book. 
We outline some of the models and subsequent metaphors 
that have been used to describe the economy---clockwork, 
machine, engine---and suggest a new metaphor---the 
metabolism of an organism.
We give an overview of Leontief Input-Output methods
and their extension to include energy and material inputs
and waste flows out of the economy.
We then propose a new Input-Output analysis method,
fitting to the new metaphor of the metabolic economy;
a dynamic accounting framework that includes accumulation of stocks
within economic sectors.}
