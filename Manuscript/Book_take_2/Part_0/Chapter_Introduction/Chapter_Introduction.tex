In this chapter we give our motivation for writing this book. 
We outline some of the models and subsequent metaphors 
that have been used to describe the economy---clockwork, 
machine, engine---and suggest a new metaphor---the 
metabolism of an organism.
We give an overview of Leontief Input-Output methods
and their extension to include energy and material inputs
and waste flows out of the economy.
We then propose a new Input-Output analysis method,
fitting to the new metaphor of the metabolic economy;
a dynamic accounting framework that includes accumulation of stocks
within economic sectors.}

\label{sec:exogenous_factors}
%%%%%%%%%%

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:stall_is_a_problem}, 
very little of the discourse 
about mature economy slowdown 
in mainstream economic circles
involves biophysical factors.
In this context, we are using the term ``biophysical factors''
to indicate any factor related to 
the extraction, transport, processing, manipulation, and disposal 
of the physical (as opposed to financial) manifestation 
of any material or energy resource in the economy.
Because biophysical factors are beyond the scope of mainstream economic discussion,
they are considered \emph{exogenous} to the economy.%
	\footnote{
	Of course, mainstream economics discusses \emph{prices}
	of raw materials, goods, and services. 
	And, to the extent that biophysical factors affect prices,
	it could be said that mainstream economic discussions involve
	biophysical factors.
	However, biophysical factors are rarely acknowledged as causal 
	for establishing the prices of goods and services and the raw materials 
	of which they are comprised.
	}

Arguably, the most important biophysical factor 
vis-\`{a}-vis the economy is energy.
If we are to understand how exogenous factors cause economic slowdown
and, conversely, drive economic growth,
it is imperative that we understand how energy operates in the economy.
Thus, in the subsections below,
we first discuss the correlation 
between energy consumption and economic activity.
Then, we show how economic demands for energy and materials
are related to important stocks 
of raw materials and energy carriers in the biosphere 
and the stocks of manufactured capital in the economy.


%+++++++++ Energy-economy links ++++++++++
\subsection{Links between energy and the economy}
\label{sec:energy-economy_links}
%+++++++++

The most important exogenous biophysical factor is energy,
because all manufactured goods are made and services provided
from raw materials that have been
manipulated, processed, or otherwise transformed by energy.
Indeed, energy consumption and economy activity are highly correlated,
as Cleveland, et.\ al.\ showed in 1984. 
(See Figure~\ref{fig:Cleveland1984}.)

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Part_0/Chapter_Introduction/images/Cleveland1984.pdf}

between energy and economic activity from 1890 to 1982.

\label{fig:Cleveland1984}
\end{figure}

Because of the high correlation between energy consumption and economic activity,
it stands to reason that energy \emph{scarcity} will hinder economic activity.
Of course, there are degrees of scarcity. 
In the vernacular, ``scarcity'' can be synonymous with ``shortage,''
meaning that energy becomes increasingly difficult to purchase in the economy,
as observed in the US during 1970s oil crisis.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:gas_shortage}.)

\begin{figure}[!ht]

****
\label{fig:gas_shortage}
\end{figure}

In the economic sense (as opposed to the vernacular sense), 
and in the absence of price controls, 
scarcity of any good should be manifest as increasing prices.
For example, a dramatic oil price spike was the result of
scarcity caused by the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s.
A similar oil price spike in the 2003--2009 timeframe
was caused by demand increasing faster than production, the definition of scarcity.
Scarcity sufficient to cause price increases need not be accompanied
by shortages.

In both cases (1970s and 2000s), 
significant slowing of economic activity (recessions)
followed the oil prices spikes.
These are not isolated cases.
Economist James Hamilton has noted that 
10 of the 11 US postwar recessions 
involve the same pattern.\cite[p.~45]{Hamilton:2013vc}
It is clear that 
there is a correlation between energy consumption and economic activity.

But, what are the dynamics that cause economic slowdowns 
to follow energy price spikes?
When prices rise faster than the cost of production, 
the profit motive should, according to economic theory, induce 
new firms to enter the oil production business and
established firms to increase production.
However, the timing of supply and demand events is crucial.
If firms don't increase production to meet demand, 
oil prices will remain elevated.
In the absence of increased production, falling demand will 
bring prices back to earth.

The rate at which oil production can be increased 
is of the utmost importance.
There are physical and technological limits 
to the \emph{rate} at which energy production can be increased.
For example, increasing worldwide oil production by, say, 20\% would involve
finding additional oil deposits, drilling additional wells, installing new pumps,
and expanding transport and delivery infrastructure around the world.
Perhaps that could be accomplished in a 5-year timeframe, but 
it would be physically and technologically impossible in a 3-month timeframe.
In, say, a 2-year timeframe, it might be physically and technologically possible
to increase oil production by 20\%, 
but it would be extremely costly to do so,
and the profit motive would be absent.
Thus, temporal considerations added to physical and technological constraints 
lead to tight linkages between financial considerations in the economy 
and biophysical considerations of the biosphere.
Temporal considerations are the point at which the economy 
becomes coupled to the biosphere.

% These dynamics help to explain several aspects of the links between energy and the economy.
% First, an inability to increase energy production to meet demand
% implies a constraint on economic activity.
% Second, rapid price spikes
% (indicating quickly-increasing scarcity due to either rapidly increasing demand or
% rapidly falling availability)
% provide a more-severe economic impact.

Recently, a few authors have found that \emph{energy cost share} 
provides a reasonable explanatory variable for the energy-economy dynamics.
Energy cost share ($f_E$) is defined, for any period of time, as
%
\begin{equation}
	f_E \equiv \frac{\displaystyle\sum_i p_i Q_i}{GDP}
\end{equation}
%
where 
the subscript $i$ indicates types of energy 
(electricity, gasoline, natural gas, etc.),
$p$ indicates the price of energy,
$Q$ indicates the quantity of energy purchased within the economy, and
$GDP$ is gross domestic product.

To our knowledge, 
Bashmakov~\cite{Bashmakov:2007ek} was the first to 
identify a long-term sustainable range for energy cost share
in mature economies.
He also showed that developed economies 
can sustain high total energy cost share ($f_E$) 
for a short period of time 
(possibly 2--3 years) 
before recessionary pressures 
destroy energy demand,%
	\footnote{
	Note that ``destruction of energy demand'' 
	is accomplished through recession
	in the short run.
	}
stimulate energy efficiency,%
	\footnote{
	Like increasing oil production, 
	increasing energy efficiency also has 
	physical and technological limits.
	Increased energy efficiency is a medium- to long-term process. 
	}
reduce energy prices, 
and return total energy cost share to its long-term sustainable range.
On the other hand, reduction of total energy cost share below 
a lower bound provides economic stimulus, 
increases energy demand, 
provides upward pressure on energy prices, 
and returns energy cost share to its long-term sustainable range.
Bashmakov speculates that 
``energy affordability thresholds and behavioral constants'' 
are responsible for the stable range of energy cost share 
over many decades.\cite[p.~3585]{Bashmakov:2007ek} 
 
The long-term stable range for economy-wide energy cost share 
is 8--10\% for the US and 9--11\% for the OECD. 
The stable and narrow range of energy cost share 
for final consumers in the U.S. is 4--5\% and in the OECD is 4.5--5.5\%.
The oil cost share threshold that correlates with US recessions 
is about 5.5\%.\cite{Murphy:2011jh}

The picture emerging from this research shows that 
the cost share of energy in the economy
(and, perhaps more narrowly, oil cost share)
is an important factor in stimulating or holding back economic growth,
despite its small value (typically, less than 10\%). 

This may be somewhat surprising to mainstream economics, 
which ascribes importance 
based on \emph{financial} information, 
not \emph{physical} information. 
Indeed, the cost share of energy in mature economies is low, 
and viewing energy as relatively unimportant is justified if
one's view of ``importance'' is limited to financial information only.%
	\footnote{
	Embarking on an economic growth path
	appears to reduce the energy cost share in an economy from very high values
	(indicating that nearly all economic activity is focused on procuring energy)
	to small values that remain within a stable range.
	For example, Sweden's energy cost share has stabilized at 12\% since 1970,
	although it was nearly 100\% in 1800.\cite{Stern:2012ey}.
	}
But, many have noted that the physical importance of energy to the economy 
far exceeds its cost share.\cite{Ayres:2013aa}
And, as discussed above, because the biophysical world is coupled 
to the economy through time considerations, 
the physical importance of energy far exceeds its financial importance.
Eventually, the coupling between energy and the economy 
has economic impacts that are difficult to see (when you're focused on financials only)
but impossible to ignore (when recessions destroy economic value).
It appears that the economy-biosphere system has 
a built-in feedback mechanism that 
enforces alignment between biophysical limits and the economy.
















In particular,
	natural resource extraction rate limits,
	
	material substitutability
whether you think the materials and energy upon which our economies currently depend
	can be easily substituted by other, readily-available, inexpensive resources; and
whether you think that the world's economies have exceeded 
	the biosphere's waste assimilation capacity.




drawing down of natural capital (both sources and sinks)

increasing (material and energy) cost of obtaining resources

reduced quality and quantity of ecosystem services, e.g. flows that do not enter the economy and assimilative capacity of the biosphere

Depletion of high-quality resource stocks (materials and energy)

More evidence (graphs from Haollick and Hall, Tverberg, etc.)




 within mainstream economic policy discussions
addresses exogenous factors.



acknowledges that exogenous factors may be causing the economic slowdown
in mature economies.

is the key to continued growth. [Reference Thomas Friedman here,
