\abstract*{In this chapter we give our motivation for writing this book. 
We outline some of the models and subsequent metaphors 
that have been used to describe the economy---clockwork, 
machine, engine---and suggest a new metaphor---the 
metabolism of an organism.
We give an overview of Leontief input-output methods
and their extension to include energy and material inputs
and waste flows out of the economy.
We then propose a new input-output analysis method,
fitting to the new metaphor of the metabolic economy;
a dynamic accounting framework that includes accumulation of stocks
within economic sectors.}

by year 50 the cost of maintaining the capital stock has overwhelmed the income from resource extraction, so profits are no longer sufficient to keep investment ahead of depreciation. The operation quickly shuts down, as the capital stock declines. The last and most expensive of the resource stays in the ground; it doesn’t pay to get it out~\cite[p.60]{Meadows2008}

%%%%%%	Burning question		%%%%%%
\section{Burning question: how can you maintain a system of national accounts without accounting for natural assets?}
\label{sec:burning_question}
%%%%%%

Unpack later to mean flows between the economy and the biosphere.

%%%%%% Problem		%%%%%%
\section{Problem: Our accounting systems are inadequate}
\label{sec:problem}
%%%%%%

We're not counting materials, energy, and economic value in a way that allows society to (a) understand the connections between energy and the economy and (b) plan for a future in which energy transitions/transformations will occur. Why is this important?

%%%%%% Transformations		%%%%%%
\subsection{The world is facing energy transformations}
\label{sec:transormations}
%%%%%%



%%%%%% Planning		%%%%%%
\subsection{We need to plan for the imminent transformations}
\label{sec:planning}
%%%%%%

Either the transformations will happen to us, or we will plan for them. We believe that planning is preferred.

%%%%%%	Economic structure	%%%%%%
\subsection{Structure of the economy is important}
\label{sec:structure}
%%%%%%

To plan for the coming transformation, we need to know the existing materials and energy structure of our economy. And, we need to know where materials and embodied energy accumulate in economic sectors and infrastructure. In short, we need to understand the connections between energy and the economy.

%%%%%%	Isolated machine metaphor	%%%%%%
\subsection{Materials and energy not accounted}
\label{sec:accounting}
%%%%%%

However, we (as a society) are not accounting the necessary things to help us plan for the economic challenges that will accompany the impending energy transformation. In fact, Congress is preventing the BEA from doing this! (See Prologue.)


%%%%%%	Scarcity	%%%%%%
\subsection{Relative vs. absolute scarcity and depletion!}
\label{sec:scarcity}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Solution	%%%%%%
\section{Solution: we need to account for materials and energy}
\label{sec:solution}
%%%%%%

Our book provides a dynamic model that shows (a) what should be accounted and (b) how to analyze the data. This is a step along the path of solving the stated problem.

%%%%%% Collective imagination	%%%%%%
\section{Why is our collective imagination stuck on a view of the economy as isolated from the biosphere?}
\label{sec:collective_imagination}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Isolated machine metaphor	%%%%%%
\subsection{The isolated economy}
\label{sec:isolated_economy}
%%%%%%

The isolated machine metaphor for the economy tells us that structural transformations will occur smoothly. 
     The isolated machine metaphor leads to some incorrect assumptions:

%%%%%%	Economy not connected to biosphere	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{No connection between the economy and the biosphere}
\label{sec:no_connection}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Infinite resources	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Resources are always available}
\label{sec:infinite_resources}
%%%%%%

Resources are always available.  If a particular resource is becomes scarce, substitute.

%%%%%% Infinite waste		%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Infinite assimilative capacity for wastes}
\label{sec:infinite_waste}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Internal dynamics	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Only internal dynamics affect the economy}
\label{sec:internal_dynamics}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Economic forces	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Economic forces (through prices and the market mechanism) will smoothly guide transition processes to good and just outcomes}
\label{sec:economic_forces}
%%%%%%


%%%%%% Machine endures	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{The machine can and will carry on}
\label{sec:machine_endures}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Destructive transformations	%%%%%%
\subsection{Transformations have been rocky to this point. (eg. 1973, 2008)}
\label{sec:transformations}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Wrong models	%%%%%%
\subsection{Perhaps our economic models are wrong}
\label{sec:wrong_models}
%%%%%%

But, economic models are informed by metaphors. Perhaps our metaphors are wrong.

%%%%%%	Importance of metaphors		%%%%%%
\subsection{Importance of metaphors}
\label{sec:importance_metaphors}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Requirements	%%%%%%
\section{Attributes for an apt metaphor for the economy}
\label{sec:metaphor_requirements}
%%%%%%

see first column of table below

%%%%%% Inputs from biosphere	%%%%%%
\subsection{Intakes materials and energy from the biosphere}
\label{sec:inputs}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Internal exchanges	%%%%%%
\subsection{Exchanges materials and information and dissipates energy internally}
\label{sec:internal_exchange}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Discharges wastes	%%%%%%
\subsection{Discharges wastes to the biosphere}
\label{sec:discharges_waste}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Accounts for scarcity	%%%%%%
\subsection{Accounts for effects of scarcity (non-linearly) in the face of low-substitutability (and uncertainty)}
\label{sec:accounts_for_scarcity}
%%%%%%

%%%%%% Importance of energy	%%%%%%
\subsection{Places importance on energetic costs}
\label{sec:importance_of_energy}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Dynamics and structure	%%%%%%
\subsection{Able to address dynamics and structural transformations}
\label{sec:structure}

Able to describe energy embodied in capital stock of economic sectors.

%%%%%%	Vefifiable	%%%%%%
\subsection{Informs models that are verifiable against historical data}
\label{sec:verifiable}
%%%%%%

%%%%%%	Metabolic metaphor %%%%%%
\section{The metabolic economy}
\label{sec:metabolic_economy}
%%%%%%

Perhaps a better metaphor for the economy is a metabolism (Greek root means ``change''). 

%%%%%%	Metabolisms work %%%%%%
\subsection{Metabolism captures the desired attributes}
\label{sec:metabolism_works}
%%%%%%
     
Metabolisms have the characteristics to meet the requirements outlined above.
How can we fill in the metabolism metaphor? What ``ideas ... are lying around''?

\begin{landscape}
\begin{table}
\label{tab:metabolic_economy}
\caption{Attributes of the real economy that should be captured by our economic models and metaphors 
				and ``useful ideas'' (analytic tools) that can be used to capture these attributes.}

\end{table}
\end{landscape}

How can we fill in the metabolism metaphor? There are ideas “lying around” that can address these important aspects of economies. (See middle column of table.) However, ideas 1–5 above create snapshots of flows. None (except 6) provides structural information. In other words, 1–5 talk about the blood, not the bones. We need to understand flows (blood) and structure (stocks, bones). 6 helps with that

%%%%%%	Analytic tools	%%%%%%
\subsection{Filling in the metabolism metaphor with useful ideas: analytic tools}
\label{sec:analytic_tools}
%%%%%%

What analytical tools and data are at our disposal?
(Each sub-point below ties to the same sub-points in Item 7 above.)

%%%%%%	MFA	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Material flow analysis (MFA)}
\label{sec:MFA}
%%%%%%

MFA, EW-MFA: Stresses the importance of material intake

%%%%%%	I-O	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Input-Output (I-O) method}
\label{sec:I-O}
%%%%%%

I-O method: Highlights importance of internal exchanges

%%%%%%	LCA	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Life cycle analysis (LCA)}
\label{sec:LCA}
%%%%%%

LCA, EIOLCA: Focuses attention on otherwise-neglected wastes

%%%%%%	NEA	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Net energy analysis}
\label{sec:NEA}
%%%%%%

EROI: Predicts that energy resource scarcity reduces EROI and increases prices

%%%%%%	EI-O method		%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Energy Input-Output (EI-O) method}
\label{sec:EI-O}
%%%%%%

EI-O method: gives prominence to energetic costs for all internal flows

%%%%%%	CV modeling		%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Thermodynamic control volume (CV) modeling}
\label{sec:CV_modeling}
%%%%%%

Thermodynamic control volume modeling: captures transient behavior 
and transformations.  
Provides ``accounting'' equations.

%%%%%%	Historically verifiable 	%%%%%%
\subsection{Apt metaphor should inform models that are verifiable against historical data}
\label{sec:historically_verifiable}
%%%%%%

Furthermore, an apt metaphor should inform models that are verifiable against historical data. We need a way to collect and categorize the information. The SNA is supposed to do that. But, the BEA doesn’t include important information (material flows and accumulation, for example) in the SNA. 

%%%%%%	National Accounts	%%%%%%
\subsubsection{System of National Accounts}
\label{sec:national_accounts}
%%%%%%

System of National Accounts: provides data for analysis and verification purposes.  
Needs to be expanded.

These facts bring us back to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item our burning question: how can you maintain a system of national accounts without accounting for natural assets? and
	\item stated problem: we're not counting materials, energy, and economic value in a way that allows society to
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item understand the connections between energy and the economy
					\item plan for a future in which energy transitions/transformations will occur.
				\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%	Restate the problem 	%%%%%%
\section{Restate the Problem: we're not counting materials, energy, and value}
\label{sec:restate_problem}
%%%%%%

We’re not counting materials, energy, and value in a way that allows society to: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item understand the connections between energy and the economy
	\item plan for a future in which energy transitions/transformations will occur.
\end{enumerate} 




%%%%%%	Need		%%%%%%
\section{Need: a new modeling approach}
\label{sec:need}
%%%%%%

Need: A modeling approach that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item brings together the ideas ``lying around,''
	\item has the potential to describe structural transformations of the economy, and 
	\item provides a framework for improved economic and environmental accounting.
\end{enumerate} 


%%%%%%	Approach		%%%%%%
\section{Methodological approach}
\label{sec:approach}
%%%%%%

Our approach to meet the need is to develop a dynamic model by applying rigorous thermodynamics to economies, informed by the ideas lying around and the metabolic metaphor, in a manner that is verifiable against the existing (or expanded) System of National Accounts (SNA).

Where and how should we apply rigorous thermodynamics to develop our dynamic model? 

%%%%%%	Structure		%%%%%%
