\begin{quote}
	``Now! Now!'' cried the Queen. 
	``Faster! Faster!'' 
	And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, 
	hardly touching the ground with their feet, 
	till suddenly, 
	just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, 
	they stopped, 
	and she found herself sitting on the ground, 
	breathless and giddy. 
	The Queen propped her against a tree, and said kindly, 
	``You may rest a little now.''

	Alice looked round her in great surprise. 
	``Why, I do believe we've been under this tree all the time! 
	Everything's just as it was!''

	``Of course it is,'' said the Queen: ``what would you have it?''

	``Well, in \emph{our} country,'' said Alice, still panting a little, 
	``you'd generally get to somewhere else---if you ran very fast for a long time, 
	as we've been doing.''

	``A slow sort of country!'' said the Queen. 
	``Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. 
	If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!''
