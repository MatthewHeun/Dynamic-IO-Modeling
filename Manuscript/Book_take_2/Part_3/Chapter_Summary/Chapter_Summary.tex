\abstract*{This chapter summarizes the book 
and tries to plow some common ground
between mainstream and ecological economists.
We encourage mainstream economists to see that it is 
both possible and essential to account for materials and energy flows
between the economy and the biosphere.
We believe there should be no reason to fear metrics such as energy intensity
that will become increasingly important into the future.
Finally, we encourage ecological economists to see that 
application of mechanistic thermodynamic accounting equations
and careful record-keeping can provide significant
insights on the ways that economies interact
with the biosphere, all the while accepting the 
mainstream subjective theory of value.}


We indicated at the outset (Chapters~\ref{chap:intro} and~\ref{chap:acct_for_won})
that this book would be about counting and change;
counting materials, counting energy, and counting economic value,
so that we can manage the upcoming energy transition
and find our way in the age of resource depletion.
Our motivation for counting more carefully
is mounting evidence (discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}) that 
scarcity of materials, energy, and 
assimilation capacity of the biosphere are affecting
the economies of our world, thereby affecting us all.
We should know precisely \emph{how} and \emph{at what rate} 
we are using our material and energy resources today
if we are to undertake the necessary transition to 
a more sustainable global economy.
But, before collecting such data,
we argued that we, as a society, 
need a rigorous theoretical framework for better systems of national accounts, 
one that goes beyond GDP and one that is relevant to the age of resource depletion.

To develop such an accounting framework,
we applied thermodynamic control volume accounting equations 
guided by the metabolism metaphor
to economies that are \emph{open} to their surroundings
(Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value}).
Similar equations are often applied to thermodynamic machines:
engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and power plants.
Application of our framework shows that 
national accounting should gather and disseminate
much additional physical, material data on real economies.
We need balance sheets in addition to income statements!
We need accounting in physical units in addition to financial units.
Work to account such flows is starting to be
undertaken at the economy-wide level,
particularly within Europe.\cite{EUROSTAT2011}
This work needs to continue, 
but sub-economy, inter-sector material and energy 
accounts need to be developed, too.

The need for rigorous and accurate data
is all the more pressing in light of the need 
to track the accumulation 
of manufactured capital and associated embodied energy
in sectors of the economy,
as suggested in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}.
There is a critical need for systematic
collection and public dissemination of such data 
by a centralized agency, but
as discussed in the Prologue, 
such accounting is currently non-existent in the US.
It was suspended by congress after the first
Integrated Environmental-Economic System of Accounts (IEESA)
tables were published in 1994.

The business axiom ``you can't control what you don't measure''
seems appropriate here. 
As the world confronts significant challenges
in the age of resource depletion,
it will be impossible to make wise decisions about
which materials to use,
which energy sources to develop, and 
which products to incentivize
without such data.
We add our voices to those encouraging governments and 
institutions to collect high-quality data on material 
and energy stocks and flows.

To that end, we recommend that the items in the following list be pursued as next steps.
Some of these items apply to national accounting worldwide
and some items apply specifically to the US.

**** Need Becky's review of this list. ****

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{National accounting agencies worldwide should seek and be given
			mandates to estimate and disseminate information on 
			the value of transactions that occur outside of the market.
			In the US, the Bureau for Economic Analysis (BEA) should seek authorization 
			to re-start the IEESA. 
			(See the Prologue.)
			Doing so will allow accounting for material and energy resources
			that are currently outside of the market.
			(See Sections~\ref{sec:energy-economy_coupling}
			and~\ref{sec:change_needed}.)}
	\item{National accounting agencies worldwide should develop and maintain 
			balance sheets of both nautral and manufactured capital 
			in addition to income statements.
			Doing so will allow countries to assess whether they are at risk of drawing down
			their wealth to produce today's income, 
			thereby jeopardizing future quality of life.
			(See the Prologue and Section~\ref{sec:wealth_nations}.)}
	\item{All stocks and inter-sector flows should be provided 
			in physical as well as financial units.
			At present, national accounting disseminates data in financial units,
			not physical units such as kilograms and kilojoules,
			thereby disguising the biphysical nature of the economy.
			Doing so will allow analysis of the true 
			\emph{biophysical} nature of the economy.}
	\item{In the US, the BEA should restart detailed 
			Capital, Labor, Energy, Material, and Services (KLEMS)
			reporting.
			**** Becky, provide a sentence or two on what has been lost.
			They used to report per-sector. 
			Now, only aggregate values are reported. 
			Perhaps something like
			``In the past, KLEMS data were estimated and disseminated by the BEA
			on a per-sector basis.
			However, today, only economy-wide aggregate values are provided.[reference 
			to BEA KLEMS here.]''
			****
			Doing so will provide detailed, sector-level information 
			on material and energy flows
			in financial units.}
	\item{The US BEA should expand KLEMS to include the origin of all flows.
			At the time when KLEMS provided sector-level detail, 
			only aggregated \emph{inflows} to a sector were reported;
			the origins of diasggregated inflows was not reported.
			Doing so will provide a better picture, in financial units,
			of the structure of materials and energy dependence among economic sectors.}
	\item{Additional detail should be provided for waste flows.
		 	**** Becky, please review and revise. 
			Perhaps we can say something like
			``At present, aggregated flows into the waste sector are reported in financial units. 
			However, the origin of these flows is not reported.'' ****
			Doing so will allow for analyses of opportunities for recycling and re-use
			within economies.
			(See Sections~\ref{sec:autophagy} and \ref{sec:recycling}.)}
	\item{All data on stocks and inter-sector flows should be reported by a single, 
			centralized agency
			in both financial and physical units.
			This will require synchronizing and reconciling data that is now reported
			by several different organizations. 
			In the US, for example, the Energy Information Agency~(EIA) and the BEA
			should combine their respective energy data.
			The Environmental Protection Agency~(EPA) and the BEA 
			should combine their respective waste data.
			Perhaps more than any other change, 
			reporting in both physical and financial units 
			would highlight the interconnectedness
			of the economy and the biosphere to the world at large.}
	\item{The US BEA should publish capital formation data that does not include
			intellectual property. 
			Doing so will avoid double-counting of capital stock.
			(See Section~**** the section that discusses IP as capital. ****)}
	\item{All of the above should be estimated and disseminated on an annual basis.
			**** Becky, please add a sentence here. Perhaps it would be something like
			``At present, the US BEA reports GDP and most financial flow information 
			annually.
			However, economy-wide KLEMS data are reported every five years.'' ****
			Doing so will allow for assessment of trends 
			in the material and energy structures of economies.}
\end{enumerate}

There should be no illusion that this agenda will be easy to pursue.
In many places, 
it will be politically difficult to undertake these changes.
But, if we, as a society, can begin collecting these data, 
perhaps we can begin to also utilize
the analytical tools, metrics, and knowledge
needed to go beyond GDP 
and make wise choices for the future.
We hope that this book makes a positive contribution in that direction.
