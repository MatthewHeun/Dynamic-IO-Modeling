\abstract*{This chapter summarizes the book 
and tries to plow some common ground
between mainstream and ecological economists.
We encourage mainstream economists to see that it is 
both possible and essential to account for materials and energy flows
between the economy and the biosphere.
We believe there should be no reason to fear metrics such as energy intensity
that will become increasingly important into the future.
Finally, we encourage ecological economists to see that 
application of mechanistic thermodynamic accounting equations
and careful record-keeping can provide significant
insights on the ways that economies interact
with the biosphere, all the while accepting the 
mainstream subjective theory of value.}


We said at the outset (Chapter~\ref{chap:intro})
that this book would be about counting and change:
counting materials, counting energy, and counting economic value,
so that we can manage the upcoming energy transition.
Our motivation for counting more carefully
is mounting evidence that 
scarcity of materials, energy, and 
assimilation capacity within the biosphere are affecting
the economies of our world, thereby affecting us all.
We should know precisely \emph{how} and \emph{at what rate} 
we are using our material and energy resources today
if we are to undertake the necessary transition to 
a more sustainable global economy.

We discussed the importance of metaphors and models:
because they become a lens through which we perceive the world,
we had better get them right.
Historically, mainstream economists have used the \emph{machine} metaphor
to describe economies. 
In fact, much of mathematical economic modeling today 
relies upon mechanistic conceptual foundations whose roots 
are in Newtonian physics
and The Enlightenment.\footnote{The subfield 
	of longwave economic growth modeling, as an example, 
	uses mechanistic language to describe their equations. 
	Jones refers to the ordinary differential equations 
	that describe births, deaths, and the production of ideas
	as ``laws of motion.''~\cite[pp.~6 \&~18]{Jones:2001wn} }
If your metaphor is a machine, it makes sense to analyze economies
with equations that describe machines.
In the mainstream, such equations are usually, but not exclusively or restrictively,
developed assuming that the economic machine is an \emph{isolated} system,
with no material or energy flows between the biosphere and the economy.

In contrast, we take the strong position that economies are
better-represented as open, organic organisms with active metabolisms.
Economies, like organisms,
exchange material, energy, and wastes with the biosphere.
Because economies are, in this way, \emph{coupled} to the biosphere,
we must develop materials, energy, and value accounting frameworks
\emph{under the assumption of} and \emph{including} 
vigorous and necessary interactions between
the economy and the biosphere.
Our use of the metabolism metaphor is anathema to many 
mainstream economists but embraced by many ecological economists.

To develop our accounting framework, 
we applied thermodynamic control volume accounting equations 
to economies that are \emph{open} to their surroundings
(Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value}).
Similar equations are often applied to thermodynamic machines:
engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and power plants.
Our equations are unabashedly mechanistic, 
and, in this regard, we are similar to mainstream economics.
Some ecological economists, 
who would otherwise be predisposed to view the economy as metabolic,
would reject our use of mechanistic equations 
to describe the economy, in part because such equations often assume a 
machine that operates independently from the biosphere.
Other ecological economists dismiss mainstream economics 
and its mechanistic equations out of hand.\footnote{For example, 
	S{\"o}llner pejoratively says 
	``The prime example of physics envy and the desire 
	to emulate the natural sciences is, of course, 
	neoclassical economics which was explicitly and purposefully 
	copied from classical mechanics.''~\cite[p. 178]{Sollner:1997wx}}

But, it doesn't have to be this way.
We claim that it is not the mechanistic mathematical models
and their equations that are the problem.
Rather, it is the application of such equations 
to an assumed isolated system
that is is worthy of criticism.

When accounting for material flows through economies (Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}),
we found that resources extracted from the biosphere are used for 
(a) build-up of capital stock within society and economic sectors, 
(b) production of short-term material flows among economic sectors, or
(c) overcoming depreciation of capital.
When accounting for both materials and energy (Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}),
we noted that the material and energy resources upon which economies depend
are obtained from the biosphere and wastes and depreciated
material return to the biosphere.
In this sense, economies are ``coupled'' to the biosphere.
When accounting for embodied energy (Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}),
we found that the waste heat from each sector 
is \emph{additive to} the embodied energy of the products of the sector.

As we accounted for economic value 
(Chapter~\ref{chap:value}),
we found it necessary to develop careful definitions.
We pragmatically accepted the subjective theory of value espoused 
by mainstream economics, despite our misgivings 
about externalities, intergenerational equity, 
and mis-measurement of economic growth.
Although we emphatically stop short of an ``energy theory of value,'' % chktex 38
we agree with many ecological economists
who find it important to estimate and communicate 
the energy intensity of economic products (Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}).
With such information, consumers will be able to make
better choices about the products and services they use.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:implications}, we noted several implications
that our framework brings to previous methods of analyzing 
the interactions among materials, energy, and the economy.
In particular, we recommended that a physical accounting framework
be adopted if we are to accurately determine
both the accumulation rate of energy embodied
in capital stock
and the energy embodied in economic products.

Along the way, we noted several items of unfinished business
that are collected in Chapter~\ref{chap:unfinished_business}.
Foremost is the paucity of data
needed to account well for materials, energy, and economic
value flows through our economies.
For example, the US no longer maintains the current account data
needed for the framework presented herein.
And, few other countries have ever collected and disseminated
required national accounts data on material flows that would allow
estimation of the energy intensity of goods.

\vspace{10 mm}

So, in the end, this book is about \emph{more than} counting and change.
It is a call-to-arms of sorts for data gathering and analysis.
If we are to successfully navigate the coming transitions
to new materials and energy resources, we simply \emph{must}
understand how we are using 
materials and energy today.
We cannot do so without an improved regime 
of data collection, dissemination, and analysis
about the world's economic metabolism.

We recommend that the following items be pursued as next steps.
Some of these items apply to the national accounting worldwide, 
and some apply specifically to the US.

**** Need Becky's review of this list. ****

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{National accounting agencies worldwide should seek and be given
			a mandate to estimate and disseminate information on 
			the value of transactions that occur outside of the market.
			In the US, the Bureau for Economic Analysis (BEA) should seek authorization 
			to re-start the SEEA. (See the Prologue.)}
	\item{In the US, the BEA should restart detailed 
			Capital, Labor, Energy, Material, and Services (KLEMS)
			reporting.
			**** Becky, provide a sentence or two on what has been lost.
			They used to report per-sector. 
			Now, only aggregate values are reported. 
			Perhaps something like
			``In the past, KLEMS data were estimated and disseminated by the BEA
			provided on a per-sector basis.
			However, today, only economy-wide aggregate values are provided.[reference 
			to BEA KLEMS here.]''
			****
			Doing so will provide detailed information of material and energy flows
			in financial units.}
	\item{The US BEA should expand KLEMS to include the origin of all flows.
			At the time when KLEMS provided sector-level detail, 
			only aggregated flows \emph{to} a sector were provided.
			Flow origin was not given.}
	\item{Additional detail should be provided for waste flows.
		 	**** Becky, please review and revise. 
			Perhaps we can say something like
			``At present, aggregated flows into the waste sector are provided in financial units. 
			However, the origin of these flows is not provided.''}
	\item{All inter-sector flows need to be provided in physical as well as financial units.
			At present, national accounting disseminates data in monetary units,
			not physical units such as kilograms and kilojoules.}
	\item{All inter-sectors flows need to be reported by a single, centralized agency
			in both financial and physical units.
			Perhaps more than any other change, 
			this would highlight the connections between the economy and the biosphere.}
	\item{Energy flows need to be disaggregated by type 
			(coal, oil, solar, wind, biomass, etc.).}
	\item{synchronize energy data and financial data (EIA and BEA)}
	\item{synchronize waste flow data and financial data (EPA and BEA)}
\end{enumerate}

And, this book is also an attempt to reconcile 
mainstream and ecological economics. 
We hope that mainstream economists will see that it is 
both possible and essential to account for materials and energy flows
between the economy and the biosphere.
We believe there should be no reason to spurn metrics such as energy intensity
that will become increasingly important into the future.

Finally, we hope ecological economists will see that 
application of mechanistic thermodynamic accounting equations
and careful record-keeping can provide significant
insights into the ways that economies interact
with the biosphere, all the while living within the 
prevailing subjective theory of value.
If we can find a little common ground, perhaps we can begin
to collect the data and develop the analytical tools, metrics, and knowledge
needed to make wise choices for the future.
