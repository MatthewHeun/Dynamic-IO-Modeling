We said at the outset (Chapter~\ref{chap:intro})
that this book would be about counting:
counting materials, counting energy, and counting economic value
as each flows through economies.
Our motivation for counting carefully and well
is mounting evidence that 
scarcity of materials and energy are affecting
the economies of our world, thereby affecting us all.
We should know precisely \emph{how} and \emph{at what rate} 
we are using our material and energy resources today
if we are to address the challenge of future transitions to new materials and 
new energy resources. 
**** Mik: re-work the previous sentence after writing the introduction. ****

When accounting for material flows through economies (Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}),
we found that resources extracted from the biosphere are used for 
(a) build-up of capital stock within society and economic sectros, 
(b) production of short-term material flows among economic sectors, or
(c) overcoming depreciation of capital stock.
When accounting for both materials and energy (Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}),
we noted that the material and energy resources upon which economies depend
are obtained from the biosphere and wastes and depreciated
material return to the biosphere.
In this sense, economies are ``coupled'' to the biosphere
When accounting for embodied energy (Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}),
we found that the waste heat from each sector 
is \emph{additive to} the embodied energy of the products of the sector.

We used control volume accounting equations 
from thermodynamics to develop our accounting models 
(Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:embodied_energy}).
Similar equations are often applied to thermodynamic machines:
engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and power plants.
Our equations are unabashedly mechanical, 
and, in this regard, we are utilizing (though not embracing) 
mainstream economics' machine metaphor to describe the economy.
And, our mechanistic modeling approach contrasts 
with many ecological economists
who reject, out of hand, the machine metaphor for the economy.

Because economies are coupled to the biosphere,
we applied the accounting equations 
to economies that are \emph{open} to their surroundings. 
Our metaphor for the economy is the organism, 
because organisms also exchange material, energy, and wastes with the biosphere
throughout their lives.
Our use of the metabolic metaphor is anathema to many 
mainstream economists but embraced by many ecological economists.

As we accounted for economic value 
(Chapter~\ref{chap:value}),
we found it necessary to develop careful definitions.
We pragmatically accepted the subjective theory of value espoused 
by mainstream economics, despite our misgivings 
about externalities, intergenerational equity, 
and mis-measurement of economic growth.
Although we emphatically stop short of an ``energy theory of value,'' % chktex 38
we agree with many ecological economists
who find it important to estimate and communicate 
the energy intensity of economic products (Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}).
With such information, consumers will be able to make
better choices about the products and services they consume.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:implications}, we noted several implications
that our framework brings to previous methods of analyzing 
the interactions among materials, energy, and the economy.
In particular, we need a method of estimating the accumulation rate
of embodied energy in economic sectors and society 
that is \emph{independent from} the top-down, Leontief\index{Leontief}
matrix inversion approach presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}
if we are to accurately determine
both the rate of accumulation of embodied energy in capital stock
and the energy embodied in economic products.
We pointed to process methods as a possible route 
to obtining this independent information.

Along the way, we noted several items of unfinished business
that are collected in Chapter~\ref{chap:unfinished_business}.
Foremost is the paucity of data
needed to account well for materials, energy, and economic
value flows through our economies.
For example, the U.S.\ no longer maintains the current account data
needed for the analyses presented herein.
And, few other countries have ever collected and disseminated
required national accounts data on material flows that would allow
estimation of the energy intensity of goods.

\vspace{10 mm}

So, in the end, this book is about \emph{more than} counting.
It has become a call-to-arms of sorts for data gathering and analysis.
If we are to successfully navigate the coming transitions
to new materials and energy resources, we simply \emph{must}
understand how we are currently using 
materials and energy.
We can't do so without an improved regime 
of data collection, dissemination, and analysis
about the world's economic metabolism.

And, this book has become an attempt to reconcile 
mainstream and ecological economics. 
We hope that mainstream economists will see that it is 
both possible and essential to account for materials and energy flows
between the economy and the biosphere.
We believe there should be no reason to fear metrics such as energy intensity
that will become increasingly important into the future.

Finally, we hope that ecological economists will see that 
application of mechanistic thermodynamic accounting equations
and careful record-keeping can provide significant
insights on the ways that economies interact
with the biosphere, all the while accepting the 
mainstream subjective theory of value.
If we can find a little common ground, perhaps we can begin
to collect the data and develop the analytical tools, metrics, and knowledge
needed to make wise choices for the future.
