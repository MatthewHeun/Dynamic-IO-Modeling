In Chapters~\ref{chap:direct_energy} and \ref{chap:embodied_energy}, 
we noted that energy is the currency of Thermodynamics,
and we developed accounting equations for flows of 
direct and embodied energy through an economy.
In this chapter, we develop a framework for accounting
value flows ($\dot{X}$) through economies.
Accounting flows of value is a necessary step along
the path to developing equations (in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}) 
that describe the energy intensity of intermediate
and final products within an economy.


%%%%%%%%%% Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

There is significant debate on the relationship between currency and value. 
The meaning of currency\index{currency} is straightforward: currency is the 
monetary medium of exchange for goods and services. 
The \emph{value} of goods and services is, however, 
fraught with complication.

In mainstream neoclassical economic theory\index{neoclassical economic theory},
the value of economic goods is a function of
the importance that a buyer places upon the goods 
involved in the transaction.
Thus, the value of a transacted good is subjective and may 
vary from one individual to the next. 
In market economies, individuals are free to engage in transactions to buy
and sell goods and services according to their needs and wants, 
and sellers set prices as they see fit. 
The ``value'' of a good is indeterminate 
until buyer and seller agree on price.
At the moment of price agreement, 
the value of the exchange good 
becomes known and is equal to 
the value of the currency exchanged
(in monetary units). 
**** Becky will verify the previous statement with Kurt Schaeffer. ****
So, for example, an automaker that pays \$1000 for electricity has received
\$1000 of ``value'' from the electricity producer.\footnote{The neoclassical 
interpretation (value equals currency) 
is reflected in our language. 
Informally, we might say that the automaker 
``bought \$1000 \emph{worth} of electricity,'' 
where ``worth'' indicates perceived 
\emph{value} to the purchaser.}
The currency flow and the value flow, 
although equal in magnitude, are opposite in direction. 
Currency flows from the buyer to the seller;
value flows from the seller to the buyer.
In the neoclassical view, the value 
of the transacted good to a buyer is not derived, 
in the first instance, from any measures of the production process,
such as the cost to produce the good, 
the labor used in producing the good,
the energy consumed in the production of the good,
or any other intrinsic property of the good or service.
The buyer and the seller are the sole determiners of value. 
No other agents have a voice in the matter. 

A strong critique of the neoclassical view notes that
third parties may have a stake in the transaction,
but no influence over the value of the good.
To continue with the automaker's \$1000 purchase of electricity,
a third party with a stake in the matter might be
a household located downwind of the coal-fired 
power plant that produces the electricity.
If the members of the household suffer negative health effects 
from power plant pollution, 
they might want to have a voice in determining the ``value'' of 
the transacted electricity; but they don't. 
It is often said that markets fail to include externalities
as goods are priced (valued): this is why.

A neoclassical rejoinder to this critique is that 
the political process provides a venue through which 
interests of third parties can be accommodated.
The cost to third parties can be added to production 
costs through regulations, taxes, fees, and penalties, 
thereby increasing the transacted price, 
consequently increasing the agreed ``value'' of the good,
and monetarily quantifying third-party interests.
However, not all voices in a society have equal influence,
and the political process does a poor job of listening to 
marginalized voices.\footnote{The voices
of the poor and minorities are especially difficult for 
political processes to hear.}
So, at best, the political process provides a partial remedy,
and the neoclassical rejoinder is incomplete.
Fundamentally, the neoclassical interpretation of the ``value''
of transacted goods excludes all but the buyer and seller.

Many theories of economic value have been proposed, 
and most alternatives to the mainstream subjective 
theory of value involve 
intrinsic measures of the value of goods and services.
The cost of producing a good or service provided the basis for
Adam Smith's theory of value. 
He suggested that, over the long run,
the market price for goods and services will tend toward
the ``natural price'' (cost of production).
Marxist economists are likely to adopt labor theories of value, 
wherein the value of goods and services is 
determined by the labor that went into producing them.
Others note that energy is a critical resource for economic growth
and propose an energy theory of value.

**** Becky: check the entire previous paragraph. We may need references here. ****

In the sections that follow, we adopt the mainstream neoclassical
(i.e., subjective) theory of value, despite its weaknesses, 
because (a) the mainstream theory is 
the basis upon which economies and markets operate today
and (b) the value of goods and services is easily quantified
as the agreed price. 
We do not, however, believe that adoption of a subjective
theory of value prevents quantification of intrinsic resource demands
made by products.
In fact, we will develop a model in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity} 
that combines subjectively-determined transaction values
(i.e., prices) with a method of determining the intrinsic energy content
of goods and services (in units of joules/dollar).\footnote{Our
method could be adapted to determine intrinsic resource content 
(e.g., labor, water, etc.) 
of any good or service, but the focus here is energy.}
Our approach is not another theory of value. 
Rather, it is a method of determining the intrinsic (embodied) 
resource ``content'' of goods, services, and, indeed, economic sectors themselves
\emph{given} the prevailing neoclassical (subjective) theory of value.

Simlar to the previous chapters, we will develop accounting equations
for each of our example economies (A--C) and finish 
with a detailed evaluation of value flows 
to and from the automobile industry.

Figure~\ref{fig:B_value} shows flows of value ($\dot{X}$) 
within a two-sector economy. 
Following the neoclassical interpreation of value, we note that
value flows are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction 
to the currency flows within an economy.

We can account for value flows by writing
