In Chapters~\ref{chap:direct_energy} and \ref{chap:embodied_energy}, 
we noted that energy is the currency of Thermodynamics,
and we developed accounting equations for flows of 
direct ($\dot{E}$) and embodied ($\dot{B}$) energy through an economy.
In this chapter, we develop a framework for accounting
value flows\index{economic value!flow of} ($\dot{X}$) through economies.
Accounting flows of value is a necessary step along
the path to developing equations (in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}) 
that describe the energy intensity of intermediate
and final products within an economy.

% 
% This is the original text from Matt. Becky is trying to rewrite below.
% 
% There is significant debate on the relationship between currency and value. 
% The meaning of currency\index{currency} is straightforward: currency is the 
% monetary medium of exchange for goods and services. 
% Furthermore, we can state that currency flows are equal in magnitude 
% and opposite in direction 
% to the value flows within an economy. 
% The \emph{value} of goods and services is, however, 
% fraught with complication.
% 
% In mainstream neoclassical economic theory\index{neoclassical economic theory},
% the value of economic goods is a function of
% the importance that a buyer places upon the goods 
% involved in the transaction.
% Thus, the value of a transacted good is subjective and may 
% vary from one individual to the next. 
% In market economies, individuals are free to engage in transactions to buy
% and sell goods and services according to their needs and wants, 
% and sellers set prices as they see fit. 
% The ``value'' of a good is indeterminate 
% until buyer and seller agree on price.
% At the moment of price agreement, 
% the value of the exchange good 
% becomes known and is equal to 
% the value of the currency exchanged
% (in monetary units). 
% **** Becky will verify the previous statement with Kurt Schaeffer. ****
% So, for example, an automaker that pays \$1000 for electricity has received
% \$1000 of ``value'' from the electricity producer.\footnote{The neoclassical 
% interpretation (value measured by currency) 
% is reflected in our language. 
% Informally, we might say that the automaker 
% ``bought \$1000 \emph{worth} of electricity,'' 
% where ``worth'' indicates perceived 
% \emph{value} to the purchaser.}
% The currency flow and the value flow, 
% although equal in magnitude, are opposite in direction. 
% Currency flows from buyer to seller;
% value flows from seller to buyer.
% In the neoclassical view, the value 
% of the transacted good to a buyer is not derived, 
% in the first instance, from any measures of the production process,
% such as the cost to produce the good, 
% the labor used in producing the good,
% the energy consumed in the production of the good,
% or any other intrinsic property of the good or service.
% The buyer and the seller are the sole determiners of value. 
% No other agents have a voice in the matter. 
% 
% A strong critique of the neoclassical view notes that
% third parties may have a stake in the transaction,
% but no influence over the value of the good.
% To continue with the automaker's \$1000 purchase of electricity,
% a third party with a stake in the matter might be
% a household located downwind of the coal-fired 
% power plant that produces the electricity.
% If the members of the household suffer negative health effects 
% from power plant pollution, 
% they might want to have a voice in determining the ``value'' of 
% the transacted electricity; but they don't. 
% It is often said that markets fail to include externalities
% in the price of goods: this is why.
% 
% A neoclassical rejoinder to this critique is that 
% the political process provides a venue through which 
% interests of third parties can be accommodated.
% The cost to third parties can be added to production 
% costs through regulations, taxes, fees, and penalties, 
% thereby increasing the price of the transacted good, 
% consequently increasing the agreed ``value'' of the good,
% and monetarily quantifying third-party interests.
% However, not all voices in a society have equal influence,
% and the political process does a poor job of listening to 
% marginalized voices.\footnote{The voices
% of the poor and minorities are especially difficult for 
% political processes to hear.}
% So, at best, the political process provides a partial remedy,
% and the neoclassical rejoinder is incomplete.
% Fundamentally, the neoclassical interpretation of the ``value''
% of transacted goods excludes all but the buyer and seller.
% 
% Many theories of economic value have been proposed, 
% and most alternatives to the mainstream subjective 
% theory of value involve 
% intrinsic measures of the value of goods and services.
% The cost of producing a good or service provided the basis for
% Adam Smith's theory of value. 
% He suggested that, over the long run,
% the market price for goods and services will tend toward
% the ``natural price'' (cost of production).
% Marxist economists are likely to adopt labor theories of value, 
% wherein the value of goods and services is 
% derived from the labor that went into producing them.
% Others note that energy is a critical resource for economic growth
% and propose an energy theory of value.
% 
% **** Becky: check the entire previous paragraph. We may need references here. ****
% 
% In the sections that follow, we adopt the mainstream neoclassical
% (i.e., subjective) theory of value, despite its weaknesses, 
% because (a) the mainstream theory is 
% the basis upon which most economies and markets operate today
% and (b) the value of goods and services is easily quantified
% as the agreed price. 
% We do not, however, believe that adoption of a subjective
% theory of value prevents quantification of intrinsic resource demands
% made by products.
% In fact, we will develop a model in Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity} 
% that combines subjectively-determined transaction values
% (i.e., prices) with a method of determining the intrinsic energy content
% of goods and services (in units of joules/dollar).\footnote{Our
% method could be adapted to determine intrinsic resource content 
% (e.g., labor, water, etc.) 
% of any good or service, but the focus here is energy.}
% Our approach is not another theory of value. 
% Rather, it is a method of determining the intrinsic (embodied) 
% resource ``content'' of goods, services, and, indeed, economic sectors themselves
% \emph{given} the prevailing neoclassical (subjective) theory of value.
% 
% Simlar to the previous chapters, we will develop accounting equations
% for each of our example economies (A--C) and finish 
% with a detailed evaluation of value flows 
% to and from the automobile industry.

(Outline)

\begin{outline}[enumerate]

\1 What we are not doing: creating a new ``energy theory of value''

	\2 by the late 70's the conversation morphed into an ``energy theory of value''

	\2 econmists rejected energy analysis for two reasons: 
		\3 economists thought that energy analylsis offered no addition useful information
		\3 economists rejected intrinsic theory of value\index{theory of value!intrinsic}
		promomted by energy analysts (Costanza, 1980) because it was too reductive and narrow.
		
	\2 we agree that an energy theory of value is too reductive and narrow.
	
	\2 however, we disagree that enegy analysis offers no useful information.
	
	\2 The baby was thrown out with the bathwater.

\1 what we are doing: using subjective 
theory of value\index{theory of value!subjective} combined with a technique 
that quantifies an intrinsic measure of economic activity in terms of resource
use and wastes (i.e., measures impact of of economic activity on the biosphere).

	\2 the intrinsic measure used in this paper is energy intensity: kJoules/dollar of economic output

	\2 a variety of intrinsic measures could be used, for example:

		\3 gallons of H20/dollar
		\3 tons of steel/dollar
		\3 CO2 emmitted/dollar
		\3 species destroyed/dollar
		\3 heavy metals/dollar
		\3 solid waste/dollar

	\2 used in conjunction with subjective measures of value (e.g., market prices) intrinsic measures help capture the impact of economic development on the biosphere

	\2 economic growth cannot continue indefinitely in scale, there are environmental constraints

	\2 currency flows within economies based on subjective measures of value do not a measure the interaction processes between the economy and the biosphere
		\3 some exceptions might include Pagovian taxes and other attempts to apply monetary value to intrinsic measures

	\2 subjective measures of value within an economy alone cannot foretell environmental constraints on the horizon
		\3 Our approach will \emph{also} not foretell environmental problems.
		\3 A measure of the external system is needed for control ``feedback.''
		\3 Even if ``feedback'' were available, subjective value wouldn't help.

\1 To obtain an intrinsic measure of economic activity, you need a bridge between currency flows and physical flows.  (prev. sentence: Instrinsic measures of economic impact must include some theory of value of economic output.)

	\2 we use subjective theory of value, the mainstream economic approach to measuring economic output using market prices

	\2 We acknowledge that subjective theory of value has its problems, though:

		\3 externalities

		\3 imperfect information

		\3 tax and subsidy distortions

	\2 despite these drawbacks, we use subjective theory of value because it is what today's economies are based on.

	\2 this allows us to use currency flows as a first-approximation of value flows

\1 One outcome of this approach is to highlight the paucity of information contained in current measures of the economy based solely on subjective values

	\2 An airplane has a portfolio of instruments to measure the status of a wide range of aspects of the flight and its physical status relative to the biosphere; conversely, an economy is much more complicated, yet has relatively few measures of its well-being or physical status

	\2 economic policy tends to focus on one main gauge, GDP

	\2 In addition to GDP, alternative measures of an economy's status are vital, such as:

		\3 Human Capital accumulated

		\3 Genuine Progress Indicator

%%%%%%%%%% Example A: single-sector economy %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example A: one sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} shows flows of value in the single-sector economy.
Following typical economic modeling, 
the economy is \emph{completely isolated} from the biosphere
in terms of both material inputs and wastes.
In other words, the value flows of an economy are \emph{independent from}
material inputs and wastes.
Value flows are independent from material inputs,
because raw materials have no economic value 
until they have been removed from the biosphere by the extraction industry.
Value flows are independent from wastes,
because wastes, by definition, have no economic value 
after they leave the economy.

The contrast between Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} and Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}
or Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy} is striking.  
The picture of energy flows in Figures~\ref{fig:A_materials} 
and \ref{fig:A_energy} indicates a dependence upon the biosphere 
that is not reflected in the value flows of Figure~\ref{fig:A_value}.
The isloation of the value flows from the biosphere is a consequence
of the subjective theory of value\index{theory of value!subjective} 
that underpins modern economics.
The biosphere is akin to a third party with no voice 
in determining the value of a transaction:
it is neither buyer nor seller.

\label{fig:A_value} 
\end{figure}

Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1} describes the accumulation 
of value\index{economic value!accumulation}
($X$)\nomenclature[X]{$X$}{stock of economic value [\$]} in Society (1).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_X_acct_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{X}_{11} 
	- \dot{X}_{1}
	+ \dot{X}_{gen}
	- \dot{X}_{dest}.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[X]{$\dot{X}$}{economic value flow rate [\$/s]}
\nomenclature[Xgen]{$\dot{X}_{gen}$}{rate of generation of economic value [\$/s]}
\nomenclature[Xdest]{$\dot{X}_{dest}$}{rate of destruction of economic value [\$/s]}

The following subsections discuss the terms in Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}.


%+++++++++ Example A: value generation ++++++++++
\subsection{Value Generation ($\dot{X}_{gen}$)}
%+++++++++

\noindent In Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}, 
the value generation term ($\dot{X}_{gen}$) is akin to growing apples: 
value is generated, seemingly out of nothing
(see Section~\ref{sec:Materials_Methodology}).
The factors that lead to value generation\index{economic value!generation of} 
($\dot{X}_{gen}$) include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{flow of solar energy\index{solar energy} \index{energy!solar|see{solar energy}}
	into the economy,
	as in the example of growing apples,}
	\item{extraction of resources (e.g., water\index{water}, minerals\index{minerals}, and
	fossil fuels\index{fossil fuels}) or any other unpriced goods from the biosphere,}
	\item{exploitation of the unpriced waste assimilation capacity of the biosphere,}
	\item{utilization of capital stock, labor, and energy to produce products
	that are more valuable than inputs,}
	\item{application of human ingenuity\index{ingenuity!human} 
	and innovation\index{innovation}, 
	which lead to increasingly efficient production processes.}
\end{itemize}

The above factors indicate that the process of value generation
has both direct and indirect impacts on the biosphere.
The direct impacts are obvious: 
extraction of non-renewable resources from the biosphere 
represents unsustainable overuse of natural capital.
The indirect impacts are less obvious: 
human ingenuity can lead to increased wealth,
leading to increased demand rates for goods and services, 
whose production requires ever-increasing rates 
of unsustainable natural resource extraction.

$\dot{X}_{gen}$ is accounted as ``value added'' to an industry in the BEA tables.
**** Becky: is this correct? 
Becky: look at the BEA tables' definition of ``value added'' to 
see if there is another sentence that can be added for clarification. ****


%+++++++++ Example A: value destruction ++++++++++
\subsection{Value Destruction ($\dot{X}_{dest}$)}
%+++++++++

\noindent In Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}, 
the value destruction term ($\dot{X}_{dest}$)\index{economic value!destruction of} 
is akin to consuming apples: 
value is destroyed by a process that consumes, 
or otherwise renders unusable, 
previously-valuable things in the economy
(see Section~\ref{sec:Materials_Methodology}).
The factors that lead to value destruction
($\dot{X}_{dest}$) include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{depreciation, usually associated with disposal of 
	materials and equipment to the biosphere at end of life and}
	\item{natural disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons
	that destroy equipment and property.}
\end{itemize}

$\dot{X}_{dest}$ is accounted as **** what **** to an industry in the BEA tables.
**** Becky: What do we write here? ****


%+++++++++ Example A: Economic Transactions ++++++++++
\subsection{Economic Transactions ($\dot{X}_{11}$ and $\dot{X}_{1}$)}
%+++++++++

The returning arrow in Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} 
represents transactions between 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{buyers (who receive things of value, $\dot{X}_{11}$,
	in exchange for currency), and}
	\item{sellers (who give up things of value, $\dot{X}_{1}$,
	in exchange for currency).}
\end{itemize}

The subjective theory of value\index{theory of value!subjective}
(Section~\ref{sec:Value_Methodology})
posits that buyers and sellers agree on value at the 
time of the transaction.
Thus, $\dot{X}_{1} = \dot{X}_{11}$, and Equation~\ref{eq:A_X_acct_1}
simplifies to

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_X_acct_2}	
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}	
	= \dot{X}_{gen},
\end{equation}

\noindent which indicates that value accumulates in the economy
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
due to value generation processes ($\dot{X}_{gen}$).


%+++++++++ Example A: GDP and Stock of Value ++++++++++
\subsection{GDP and the Stock of Value}
%+++++++++

If Society (1) in Figure~\ref{fig:A_value} represents 
the economy of an entire country, 
$\dot{X}_{1}$ is its gross domestic product (GDP)\index{gross domestic product}
in units of \$/year.
The stock of value, $X_1$, is the total value of everything that 
is accumulated in society.

**** Becky: anything to add to the above sections? ****


%%%%%%%%%% Example B: two-sector economy %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two sector economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:B_value} shows flows of value ($\dot{X}$) 
within a two-sector economy. 
Again, we note the isloation of value from the biosphere.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_3/Chapter_Values/images/2_sector_value.pdf}
\caption{Flows of value within a two-sector economy.}{Flows of value ($\dot{X}$) within a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_value}
\end{figure}

We can account for value flows by writing
the following equations:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{X}_{11}
	+ \dot{X}_{21}
	- \dot{X}_{1}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{X}_{12}
	+ \dot{X}_{22}
	- \dot{X}_{2}.
\end{equation}

**********
If you sell a good for more than you paid for its inputs, 
you have created value and sold it away. 
You now have more currency, and therefore, 
you have a claim on value from the economy.

%%%%%%%%%% Example C: three-sector economy %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example C: three sector economy}

Figure~\ref{fig:C_value} shows flows of value ($\dot{X}$)

\caption{Flows of value within a three-sector economy.}{Flows of value ($\dot{X}$) within a three-sector economy.}
\label{fig:C_value}
\end{figure}

We can account for value flows in Example~C with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{X}_{ij}
	- \dot{X}_{j},

% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
%% Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

%% Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all sequent paragraphs are.

%%If you want to list definitions or the like we recommend to use the Springer-enhanced \verb|description| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

%% When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
