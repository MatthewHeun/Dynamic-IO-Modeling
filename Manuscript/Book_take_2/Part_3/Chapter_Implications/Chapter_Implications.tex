Several implications can be drawn from the detailed development 
of a framework for materials and energy accounting 
(in Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:intensity})
that includes energy input from society to the economy,
embodied energy accumulation, waste material flows, and depreciation.

The first set of implications are for the I-O method itself;
specifically, for the process of estimating
the energy intensity of economic output ($\bm{\varepsilon}$).

Extension of the Leontief\index{Leontief} 
Input-Output method\index{input-output method}
for energy analysis has allowed energy analysts to estimate 
the energy intensity\index{energy intensity}
of economic products ($\bm{\varepsilon}$). 
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:Value_Methodology},
we do not take this important result as a license
to declare an intrinsic ``energy theory of value.''
\index{theory of value!energy}
Rather, we belive that energy intensity is an 
important and useful metric that can assess 
the energy performance of economies,
even within the prevailing subjective theory of value
\index{theory of value!subjective}
that underlies modern economics. 
Thus, it is important to consider the assumptions behind
the literature's presentation of the I-O method 
for estimating the energy intensity economic output.

In this manuscript, Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} 
provides a means of estimating the energy intensity of economic sectors:

\begin{equation}
	\bm{\varepsilon} 
	= {(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})}^{-1}\hat{\vec{X}}^{-1}
		\left[\vec{E}_{0} 
				+ \vec{T}_{1} 
				- \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
				- \vec{B}_{waste}
				- \hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{B}\vec{B}_{K}
		\right].\tag{\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}The I-O literature~\cite{Bullard1975,Casler1984}, 
uses a similar, but different, equation. 
In this section, we unpack the (often unstated) assumptions in the literature
and develop an expression that translates
between our analysis and the analysis typically found in the literature. 

We begin by noting that 
flows of capital stock ($\dot{K}$) are not included in the 
standard I-O tables from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\footnote{See
Section~\ref{sec:Data} for a discussion of data needs.}
Historically, only a few energy analysts attempted to include the effect
of capital flows on energy intensity ($\bm{\varepsilon}$). 
Bullard~\cite{Bullard1975} added capital stock purchases as an input
to each economic sector.
Casler~\cite{Casler:1983uy} attempted to correct the BEA's
input-output tables prior to applying the I-O method.
However, the present analysis (based on 
the model of material, energy, and value flows presented 
in Chapters~\ref{chap:materials}--\ref{chap:value})
affords the opportunity
to develop a mathematically-rigorous analysis
of the effects of physical depreciation.

Given that the BEA I-O tables do not include captial flows, 
much of the literature implicitly assumes that 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a_prime_lit}
	a_{ij}^{'} 
	\equiv \frac{\dot{X}_{ij,\dot{R}} + \dot{X}_{ij,\dot{S}}}
				{\dot{X}_{j,\dot{R}} + \dot{X}_{j,\dot{S}}}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Variables written with a ``prime''
(e.g.\ $a^{'}$) indicate definitions and terms as used in the literature.
Comparison between Equations~\ref{eq:aij_def_expanded}
and~\ref{eq:a_prime_lit}
indicates that the literature neglects capital stock flows 
($\dot{X}_{\dot{K}}$).
Thus, the the input-output matrix in the literature
($\vec{A^{'}}$) is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A_matrix_def_literature}
	\vec{A}^{'} 
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		a_{22}^{'} & a_{23}^{'}	\\
		a_{32}^{'} & a_{33}^{'}	
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Furthermore, the literature assumes that production does not include
capital stock (again, due to the fact that the BEA does not include 
capital flows in the standard I-O tables) such that

\begin{equation}
	\hat{\vec{X}}^{'} = \hat{\vec{X}}_{\dot{R}} + \hat{\vec{X}}_{\dot{S}},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}whereas our formulation (Equation~\ref{eq:X_hat_matrix_def})
includes capital flows explicitly:

\begin{equation}
	\hat{\vec{X}} = \hat{\vec{X}}_{\dot{R}} + \hat{\vec{X}}_{\dot{S}} + \hat{\vec{X}}_{\dot{K}}.
\end{equation}

The literature writes Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
	\bm{\varepsilon^{'}} 
	= {\left( \vec{I} - {\vec{A}^{'}}^{\mathrm{T}} \right)}^{-1}
	% {    \hat{  \vec{X}  }  }  ^{-1}
	{\left( \hat{\vec{X}}^{'} \right)}^{-1}
	\vec{E}_{0}.
\end{equation}

The differences between Equations~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}
and~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature} are clear. 
Most of the literature neglects
\begin{itemize}
	\item{capital flows (by using $\vec{A}^{'}$ and $\hat{\vec{X}}^{'}$
			instead of $\vec{A}$ and $\hat{\vec{X}}$),}
	\item{energy input from society ($\vec{T}_{1}$),}
	\item{accumulation of embodied energy in the economy 
			$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$,}
	\item{the embodied energy of scrap resource	and short-lived material flows 
			($\dot{\vec{B}}_{waste}$) and}
	\item{depreciation $\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{B} \vec{B}_{K}$}
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}when estimating the energy intensity  
of economic sectors ($\bm{\varepsilon}^{'}$).
In other words, most energy analysts using the input-output method
have, to date, and perhaps unwittingly, assumed 
a developed-world ($\vec{T}_{1} \ll \vec{E}_{0}$),
steady state economy\index{steady-state economy}
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{\vec{B}}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}  
= \vec{0} \right)$ 
with 
no capital flow (using $\vec{A}^{'}$ and $\hat{\vec{X}}^{'}$),
no waste ($\vec{B}_{waste} = \vec{0}$), and
no depreciation ($\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{B} = \vec{0}$).

Equations~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} 
and~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
have one common term, $\vec{E}_{0}$.
We can solve Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
for $\vec{E}_{0}$ 

\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_{0}
	= \hat{\vec{X}}^{'} \left( \vec{I} - {\vec{A}^{'}}^\mathrm{T} \right) \bm{\varepsilon^{'}} 
\end{equation}

\noindent{}and substitute into
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}
to obtain an expression that relates $\bm{\varepsilon}$ 
and $\bm{\varepsilon}^{'}$

\begin{align}
	\bm{\varepsilon}
	=& {\left( \vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \right)}^{-1} \hat{\vec{X}}^{-1}
			\hat{\vec{X}}^{'} \left( \vec{I} - {\vec{A}^{'}}^{\mathrm{T}} \right) 
			\bm{\varepsilon^{'}} 
	& + {\left( \vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}} \right)}^{-1} \hat{\vec{X}}^{\mathrm{-1}}
	\left[ \vec{T}_{1} - \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}  
			- \vec{B}_{waste} - \hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{B} \vec{B}_{K} \right].
\end{align}

simply added capital stock to embodied energy inputs to the sector. ****

\subsubsection{Negligible energy input from society $\left( \vec{T}_{1} = \vec{0} \right)$}
%+++++++++

Energy input from society to the economy ($\vec{T}_{1}$)
is ``muscle work'' supplied by working humans 
and draught animals.\cite{Ayres:2003ec,Ayres:2010ug,Warr:2012cg} 
This muscle work term ($\vec{T}_{1}$) should include
all upstream energy required to make the labor available.\footnote{It is important
to note that $\vec{T}_{1}$ should include all upstream energy,
because at this point in the development of this framework 
for accounting materials, energy, and value,
we are assuming that Final Consumption (Sector 1) is exogenous to the economy 
(Sectors 2 and 3), 
and upstream energy consumption needs to be included manually.
However, in Section~\ref{sec:what_is_endogenous}, we show that Final Consumption
can be endogenized.
Once endogenized, the energy intensity of Final Consumption ($\varepsilon_{1}$) 
will automatically include the upstream energy required to make labor available.
(See Appendix~\ref{chap:infinite_series}.)

It is important to note, too, that labor can have very high energy intensity, 
because $\varepsilon_{1}$ includes the energy required to supply food and transport
to workers.} 
For industrialized economies, muscle work 
is likely to provide only a small fraction
of the energy input from fossil fuels ($\vec{E}_{0}$),
so neglecting $\vec{T}_{1}$ causes negligible error when
estimating energy intensity ($\bm{\varepsilon}$) by
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}.
However, for some agrarian\index{economy!agrarian} 
and developing economies\index{economy!developing}, 
in which $\vec{T}_{1}$ and $\vec{E}_{0}$ 
could be on the same order of magnitude,
neglecting $\vec{T}_{1}$ could cause errors
in estimates of $\bm{\varepsilon}$.
To the extent that $\vec{T}_{1}$ 
is significant relative to $\vec{E}_{0}$,
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
will underpredict the energy intensity of the economy.

Accurate estimation of the energy intensity of economic output ($\bm{\varepsilon}$)
requires independent knowledge of the rate at which society supplies
energy to the economy~($\vec{T}_{1}$). 
Ayres and Warr have estimated human and animal muscle work
input to the economy for a few developed countries.\cite{Ayres:2010ug}
We recommend that more of this work be done 
in the future for many more countries.

\subsubsection{Negligible accumulation of embodied energy
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} = \vec{0} \right)$}
%+++++++++

As discussed in detail below (Section~\ref{sec:implications_for_development}),
the accumulation of embodied energy 
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$
in society and the economy
can be considered a marker of economic ``development.''

% **** 
% Mik says: Daly talks about this in terms 
% of Odum's B/P vs P/B ratios for growing vs.\ steady systems.

Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification} 
shows that embodied energy accumulation within economic sectors 
exclusive of depreciation
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$ 
decreases the energy intensity of products~($\bm{\varepsilon}$),
because incoming energy becomes embodied within capital stock rather than products.
Costanza points out that traditional
``input-output methodology does not include capital stocks explicitly, 
since a static equillibrium is assumed.''\cite{Costanza:1980ww}
Comparison with Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
shows that the method in the literature will overestimate the energy intensity
of economic products ($\bm{\varepsilon}$) when 
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} > 0$.

Rapidly growing economies (as measured by GDP), such as China and India today,
are expected to have rather large positive values in the  
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$ vector,
while slowly-growing, industrialized economies, 
such as the United States and the United Kingdom,
are expected to have rather smaller values in the 
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$ vector.
Applying Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature} 
(i.e., assuming a steady-state economy\index{economy!steady-state})
will tend to overestimate the energy intensity 
of economic products for rapidly growing economies such as China and India.
The approximate magnitude of mis-estimation remains unknown, because
estimates of the magnitude of
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$
have yet to be made.

Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification} shows that 
accurate estimation of the energy intensity of economic output ($\bm{\varepsilon}$)
requires \emph{independent} knowledge of the rate 
at which embodied energy accumulates in the capital stock of the economy 
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$,
and all estimates of energy intensity ($\bm{\varepsilon}$) to date have assumed 
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} = 0$.\footnote{To 
our knowledge, there are no independent estimates 
of the accumulation rate of embodied energy in the economy
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$.}
Furthermore, Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification} 
cannot be used to estimate the accumulation rate of energy embodied in 
capital stock by solving for 
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$,
because that approach would require independent knowledge
of the energy intensity of economic sectors ($\bm{\varepsilon}$).
Alternatively, Equation~\ref{eq:C_embodied_energy_accounting_123_with_depreciation} 
could be simplified using the 
methods of Section~\ref{sec:intensity_capital_correction} to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C_embodied_energy_accounting_123_with_depreciation_simplified}
	\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{K_{j}}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\dot{B}_{ij} 
	- \dot{B}_{j}
	- \dot{B}_{waste,j0}
	+ \dot{Q}_{j0},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}but this approach would require independent knowledge of the 
embodied energy of all inter-sectoral material transfers in the entire economy.

At present, the situation appears to be a catch-22. 
However, a way around the problem may come from application
of bottom-up, process-based methods to the problem 
of estimating the accumulation of embodied energy 
in economic sectors. 
Some steps have been made in this direction.\cite{brandt2013calculating}
But, clearly, further work focused on estimating the relative magnitudes of 
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$,
$\vec{T}_{1}$, and $\vec{B}_{waste}$ 
will benefit energy analysts who utilize the I-O method.


%+++++++++ Negligible embodied energy in waste ++++++++++
\subsubsection{Negligible energy embodied in waste ($\vec{B}_{waste} = 0$)}
%+++++++++

If the energy embodied in waste resources ($\dot{R}$)
and short-lived materials ($\dot{S}$) are ignored,
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification}
shows that estimates of the energy intensity of economic products 
($\bm{\varepsilon}$) will be too high.
We are unaware of any estimates of the energy embodied in wasted
material in an economy.  
But, one might develop a metric for the resource material effiency of an 
economic sector ($\eta_{\dot{R}}$)\nomenclature[h]{$\eta_{\dot{R}}$}{resource efficiency [kg/kg]} 
such that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:manufacturing_effiency}
	\eta_{\dot{R},j}
	\equiv \frac{\dot{P}_{j}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{R}_{ij}}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}With the above definition, 
the scrap rate for resources could be expressed as
$(1~-~\eta_{\dot{R}}) \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{R}_{ij}$.
Allwood et.\ al.~\cite[p. 193]{allwood2012sustainable} 
used a process-based approach to manufacturing efficiencies
for metals used in manufacturing. 
The data are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:scrap_rates}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Manufacturing efficiencies (Equation~\ref{eq:manufacturing_effiency}) 
for selected manufactured goods.\cite{allwood2012sustainable}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {r @{\hspace{2em}} l}
	\toprule
	Product & Manufacturing Efficiency [\%] \\
	\midrule
	Steel I-beam             & 90 \\
	Car Door Panel           & 50 \\
	Aluminium Drink Can      & 50 \\
	Aircraft Wing Skin Panel & 10 \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:scrap_rates}
\end{table}

Furthermore, one could assume that the rate
of short-lived materials ($\dot{S}$) used by a sector could be given as a 
fraction of the resource ($\dot{R}$) use rate such that:

\begin{equation}
	\rho_{\dot{S},j}
	\equiv \frac{\dot{S}_{j0}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{R}_{ij}}
	= \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{S}_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{R}_{ij}}.
\end{equation} \nomenclature[r]{$\rho_{\dot{S}}$}{ratio of short-lived material
flow to resource inputs [kg/kg]}

With the above definitions, the waste resource rate from an economic sector
can be given as

\begin{equation}
	\dot{R}_{j0} + \dot{S}_{j0}
	= (1 - \eta_{\dot{R}_{j}} + \rho_{\dot{S},j}) \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dot{R}_{ij}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}The embodied energy in the waste materials would need to be estimated
from the embodied energy of the incoming resource and short-lived material flows.

However, it could be argued that the embodied energy content 
of waste from the production process should be 
assigned to the products of a sector.\footnote{This approach 
is similar to assigning waste heat energy from an
economic sector to the embodied energy of its products.
See Section~\ref{subsec:A_first_law_embodied} and
Equation~\ref{eq:A_dB1/dt} for a discussion of this approach.}
If so, Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification}
could be modified as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsilon_leontief_without_waste}
	\bm{\varepsilon} 
	= {(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})}^{-1}\hat{\vec{X}}^{-1}
		\left[\vec{E}_{0} 
				+ \vec{T}_{1} 
				- \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}
		\right],
\end{equation}

\noindent{}and the waste rates are unneeded.

Further work focused on estimating values for 
$\eta_{\dot{R}}$ and $\rho_{\dot{S}}$
and the the energy embodied in waste flows 
will benefit energy analysts who utilize the I-O method.

A second set of implications for the I-O method 
comes from one of the ways that 
the energy intensity vector ($\bm{\varepsilon}$)
is often used: to estimate energy demand from the biosphere ($\vec{E}_{0}$).


%%%%%%%%%% I-O implications: estimating E %%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Estimating $\vec{E}_{0}$}
%%%%%%%%%%

The assumptions of Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
may cause another challenge for energy analysts. 
As shown in 
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification}
and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:estimating_epsilon-implications_chapter} above, 
the I-O method can be used to estimate energy intensities 
for each sector of the economy ($\bm{\varepsilon}$). 
With $\bm{\varepsilon}$ values in hand,
and assuming that $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is constant with respect to time,
energy analysts have estimated changes in energy demand 
from the biosphere ($\vec{E}_{0}$) 
as the output of economic sectors ($\hat{\vec{X}}$) 
increases or decreases by solving 
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature} 
for $\vec{E}_{0}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E}
	\vec{E}_{0} 
	= \hat{\vec{X}}(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})\bm{\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}

When Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
is modified to account for accumulation of embodied energy 
in the economy 
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$,
waste materials ($\vec{B}_{waste}$), and
energy supplied by society to the economy ($\vec{T}_{1}$),
we see that energy demands ($\vec{E}_{0}$) must be calculated differently. 
Solving Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification} 
for $\vec{E}_{0}$ gives 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Leontief_solved_for_E_with_embodied_depreciation}
	\vec{E}_{0} 
	= \hat{\vec{X}}
		(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})
		\bm{\varepsilon} 
	+ \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}
	+ \vec{B}_{waste}
	- \vec{T}_{1}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Comparison of Equations~\ref{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E} 
and~\ref{eq:Leontief_solved_for_E_with_embodied_depreciation}
shows that to the extent that embodied energy accumulation,
exclusive of physical depreciation
$\left( \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}} \right)$
is non-zero, estimates of energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$) using 
Equation~\ref{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E} are too low. 
If wastes ($\vec{B}_{waste}$) are ignored, 
estimates of energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$) using 
Equation~\ref{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E} will be too low. 
And, if energy input from society to the economy ($\vec{T}_{1}$) is significant,
estimates of energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$) using 
Equation~\ref{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E} will be too high. 

At this time, the relative magnitudes of $\vec{E}_{0}$,
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$,
$\vec{B}_{waste}$, and $\vec{T}_{1}$ are unknown. 
Further work to clarify these magnitudes will be beneficial
for energy analysts who employ the I-O method.

**** Becky, write a paragraph here about alternative measures of development. 
Discuss Daly's Genuine Progress Indicator (which includes natural capital, Mik to verify)
and Gross National Happiness and other. ****

Economic ``development''\footnote{We choose to use the word ``development'' to
describe expanding economies, despite significant misgivings about the term. 
The unambiguously positive connotations of the words ``development'' and ``developed''
fail to capture the nuances of travel along economic development paths:
there are so many ways in which life experience in ``developed'' countries 
is both better and worse than life in ``developing'' countries.
We hope to convey our misgivings by surrounding these words with quotation marks in this text.}
is usually ``measured''
by Gross Domestic Product\index{Gross Domestic Product} (GDP).
With reference to Figure~\ref{fig:C_value}, $GDP$ is calculated by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:GDP_def}
	GDP
	= \sum\limits_{j=2}^{n} \dot{X}_{j}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $n$ is the number of sectors in the economy.
Equation~\ref{eq:GDP_def} clearly shows that 
$GDP$ is a \emph{flow} of value in units of \$/year.

As a given economy moves along its ``development'' path,
sectors within the economy accumulate capital stock 
($K$, typically expressed in units of dollars)
and associated embodied energy 
($B_{K}$, expressed in units of joules).
If we turn this around, 
accumulation of embodied energy in economic sectors and society 
could be considered a \emph{proxy} for ``development.''\footnote{Embodied energy 
as a proxy for development may be overly focused on capital stock, 
therefore one-dimensional, and reductive, 
but GDP and other measures are open to similar criticism.}
Equation~\ref{eq:Dev_Integral_Economy} indicates how accumulated
embodied energy in the capital stock 
of an economy ($\vec{B}_{K}$) could be calculated:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Dev_Integral_Economy}
	\vec{B}_{K}(t) 
	= \vec{B}_{K}(0) 
	+ \int_{t=0}^{t=t} \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $\vec{B}_{K}$ is given by Equation~\ref{eq:B_vec_def}.
Equation~\ref{eq:Dev_Integral_Economy} clearly shows
that energy embodied energy in capital stock ($\vec{B}_{K}$) 
is a \emph{stock} (in units of joules), not a flow.

The behavior of $\vec{B}_{K}$ with respect to
$\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{\mathrm{other}}$ 
is vitally important. 
As an economy transitions from agrarian to industrialized, 
its capital stock ($K$) and associated embodied energy ($B_{K}$)
grows ever larger. 
The outflow of depreciated capital stock and its associated embodied energy 
will occur at a faster rate, too.
As increasingly large amounts of energy are embodied 
in the capital stock of an economy ($B_{K}$), 
Equation~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief} shows that
increasingly large energy extraction rates ($\vec{E}_{0}$) 
are required to maintain capital stock 
in the sectors of the economy
to offset the effects of depreciation 
($\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K} \vec{B}_{K}$),
assuming that $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ge 0$ 
is desired. 

During a period of rapid industrialization and infrastructure build-out, 
we expect both $GDP$ and energy embodied in the economy ($\vec{B}_{K}$)
to increase.
But, there is no guarantee that $GDP$ and $\vec{B}_{K}$ move 
in the same direction at all times.
Industrialized economies may experience $GDP$ growth while 
the stock of embodied energy in the economy ($\vec{B}_{K}$) remains nearly constant,
because the economy is running circles to overcome the effects of depreciation.
There can be a time lag between movements of GDP and $\vec{B}_{K}$, too.
At the beginning of an economic downturn (defined as prolonged GDP reduction),
capital stock and associated embodied energy ($\vec{B}_{K}$) will remain approximately constant:
GDP moves but $\vec{B}_{K}$ doesn't.
But as the GDP decline continues, 
maintenance flows for capital stock will be reduced
and depreciation will overtake maintenance leading to a decline in $\vec{B}_{K}$. 
If economic decline is associated with significant external 
infrastructure investment (such as occurred in post-colonial Africa),
GDP may decrease 
while the stock of energy embodied in the economy ($\vec{B}_{K}$) increases 
due to foreign aid focused on infrastructure enhancement.
**** We may want a better example here.
Does foreign aid inflows count toward GDP\@?
Did this actually occur for any country in post-colonial Africa? 
--MKH ****

A second possible measure of economic ``development'' is another \emph{stock}, 
wealth:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Dev_Integral_Wealth}
	X_{j}(t) 
	= X_{j}(0) 
	+ \int_{t=0}^{t=t} \frac{\mathrm{d}X_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $j=1$ for societal wealth 
and $j \in [2,n]$ for corporate wealth, both measured in dollars.
In fact, capital (as represented by energy embodied in infrastructure, $\vec{B}_{K}$) and 
financial resources (as represeted by $X_{2 \ldots n}$) 
are complimentary factors of production for economic processes. 
But, we can go further than linking capital with financial resources.
If capital~($\vec{B}_{K}$) is to be useful, we need financial resources
or currency~($\dot{X}$) to 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{purchase direct energy~($\dot{E}$) to power the capital,
	\item{purchase resources~($\dot{R}$) to feed the capital, and}
	\item{pay workers~(represented 
	by societal energy input to the economy,~$\vec{T}_{1}$) 
	to operate the capital.}
} 
\end{itemize}

Thus, economic growth could be considered a ``fully coupled'' problem:
understanding it requires breadth of knowledge and appreciation for 
interactions among many important factors.
Each of the factors discussed above 
($\dot{X}$, $\vec{B}_{K}$, $\dot{E}$, $\dot{R}$, and $\vec{T}_{1}$)
is necessary, but not sufficient, for economic growth.

Our framework serves highlight to several issues in economic ``growth.'' 
Should it be measured by a stock or a flow? 
Which measure is most appropriate? 
What roles do currency, capital stock, energy, resources, and labor
play in economic processes?
These are overlapping and complementary areas of inquiry.
We encourage further research in all of these areas.

\section{Implications for recycling, reuse, and dematerialization}
\label{sec:recycling}
%%%%%%%%%%

**** Mik: take a shot a rewriting. **** MCD---shot taken! ****

Dematerialization is the idea that economic activity can be unlinked 
from material or energy demands.\cite{FischerKowalski:2011uo} 
One method for dematerializing an economy 
is reuse and recycling of materials from both
short-lived goods
$\left(\vec{B}_{waste}\right)$
and depreciation of 
capital 
stock~$\left(\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}\vec{B}_{K}\right)$
that would otherwise have
been expended to the biosphere.\footnote{Another 
method  of dematerialization is 
substitution away from production of material goods 
and toward information and services
in an economy.}
%**** MCD - I removed the following sentence as I don't agree with it. ****
% The impact of recycling can be seen in the I-O formulation 
% only when depreciation and accumulation terms are included. 

In Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity},
we defined the rate of accumulation 
of embodied energy within the economy
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$
by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \vec{E}_{0}
	+ \vec{T}_{1}
	+ \hat{\vec{X}} (\vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}} - \vec{I})\bm{\varepsilon} 
	- \vec{B}_{waste}
	- \hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}\vec{B}_{K}\tag{\ref{eq:matrix_leontief}}
\end{equation}

One effect of recycling is to reduce the magnitude 
of the waste 
$\left(\vec{B}_{waste}\right)$
and depreciation 
$\left(\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}\right)$ 
terms,
since for a given level of capital 
stock~$\left(\vec{B}_{K}\right)$
the amount of depreciation to the 
biosphere $\left(\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}\vec{B}_{K}\right)$
will be lower due to the fraction that
is now recycled.
As can be seen by looking at 
Equation~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief},
this indicates that 
recycling of material in an economy, 
by reducing both $\vec{B}_{waste}$ 
and~$\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}$, 
puts \emph{upward} pressure on the accumulation of 
energy embodied in capital stock
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$.

Recycling has a mixed effect on energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$). 
Because recycled materials can displace newly-produced material 
in the economy and society, 
recycling will tend to reduce energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$). 
However, recycling processes require energy to operate, 
thereby putting upward pressure on energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$). 
If the energetic cost of recycling is lower than that of obtaining materials
from virgin resources, as is the case for many metals, 
e.g.\ aluminum~\cite{Chapman1975}, 
the result is a net reduction of energy demand 
from the biosphere ($\vec{E}_{0}$). 
Berry and Fels found that recycling of the material in automobiles
would result in 12,640 kW-hr of energy reduction per vehicle.\cite[p. 15]{Berry:1973vo}
Therefore recycling will also put \emph{downward} pressure on 
the growth of embodied energy in the economy
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$. 

If recycling produces a net reduction in energy demand ($\vec{E}_{0}$), 
% i.e.\ if the effect of displaced production dominates over the effect 
% of energy consumed in recycling processes, 
the upward pressure on growth 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
from decrease in depreciation 
$\left(\hat{\bm{\gamma}}_{K}\right)$ 
and the downward pressure on growth 
from net reduction in energy demand 
$\left(\vec{E}_{0}\right)$ 
can offset each other.
Under those conditions, 
the accumulation rate of energy embodied in capital stock
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
will remain near zero 
and total embodied energy 
$(\vec{B}_{K})$ will remain constant. 
In that scenario, 
dematerialization can occur: 
reduced material and energy input ($\vec{E}_{0}$) 
can be accompanied by 
no change in
the growth of the economy
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}_{K}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$.


%%%%%%%%%% Implications %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Comparison to a steady-state economy}
\label{sec:SSE}
%%%%%%%%%%

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro},
the human economy is a subset of the biosphere---a
finite, non-growing system,
\emph{open} to flows of solar energy but \emph{closed}
to material transfers.
**** I thought our argument is that the economy \emph{does}
have material transfers that the traditional economic models 
do not consider. --MKH ****
Because the biosphere is finite in size,
the human economy cannot physically grow indefinitely.
The concept of a non-growing or ``steady-state'' economy
has existed for centuries.
There are a number of different
conditions that may characterize a system as steady-state.
In thermodynamics,
the condition of a zero rate of accumulation
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$
**** Do you mean that $x$ is economic value? 
If so, use $X$.
If you mean $x$ to be a generic variable, 
why is the footnote necessary? --MKH ****
is normally used to define steady state conditions.\footnote{Or,
more generally,
a change in any property over time
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$.}
Other conditions that might define a steady-state
economy are:
a constant rate of material through-put,
constant GDP, or constant population.
Our framework,
as outlined here,
can address the first three steady-state conditions.
The fourth condition, constant population, could be
accommodated with some adaptation of the 
framework. 
The issue of human population as part of society's
capital stock is addressed in Section~\ref{sec:people_as_stock}.


%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%+++++++++ Constant capital stock ++++++++++
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Constant level of capital stock}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}, 
we introduced Equation~\ref{eq:C_CV_all_b}:

\begin{align}\tag{\ref{eq:C_CV_all_b}}
	- \frac{\mathrm{d}R_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}										&
	=\sum_{j}\frac{\mathrm{d}K_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	+ \sum_{i,j}\dot{S}_{ij}
	+ \sum_{j}\gamma_{K_{j}}K_{j}.
\end{align}

\noindent{}which indicates that 
the depletion of natural resources in the 
biosphere~$\left(- \frac{\mathrm{d}R_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$
by the economy
is used for the purposes of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{increasing man-made capital stocks
	within the economy~$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}K_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$,}
	\item{providing short-lived goods exchanged within the
	economy~$\left(\dot{S}_{ij}\right)$, and}
	\item{overcoming depreciation of man-made
	capital stocks~$\left(\sum_{j}\gamma_{K_{j}}K_{j}\right)$.}
\end{itemize}

Assuming,
first,
that a steady-state economy exists when the level
of capital stock remains constant
$\left(\sum_{j}\frac{\mathrm{d}K_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}=0\right)$,\footnote{Note
that the steady-state condition does not preclude expansion
of some sectors of the economy, provided that there is 
equal contraction elsewhere.}
we can see that Equation~\ref{eq:C_CV_all_b}
reduces to:

\begin{align}\label{eq:C_CV_all_c}
	- \frac{\mathrm{d}R_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}										&
	= \sum_{i,j}\dot{S}_{ij}
	+ \sum_{j}\gamma_{K_{j}}K_{j}.
\end{align}

A number of interesting concepts may be understood in
relation to Equation~\ref{eq:C_CV_all_c}. 
Firstly,
if our steady-state economy is to be supported
sustainably,
then withdrawal of natural resources from the biosphere
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}R_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$
had better be at some rate lower than the biosphere
can replenish the natural capital stocks. 
In reality, 
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}$
is really the sum of many different resources
(flora and fauna, water) each of which will have
its own natural rate of regeneration.
As such, 
the sustainability criterion  is a vector of values,
one for each natural resource.

Secondly,
the steady state condition 
$\left(\sum_{j}\frac{\mathrm{d}K_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}=0\right)$
says nothing about the transfer rates of short-lived goods 
within in the economy $\left(\sum_{i,j}\dot{S}_{ij}\right)$
or the depreciation of capital stock back to the biopshere
$\left(\sum_{j}\gamma_{K_{j}}K_{j}\right)$.
Equation~\ref{eq:C_CV_all_c} indicates that 
the higher the rates of these flows,
the greater the rate of depletion of
natural resources, and the more difficult it will be to
meet the sustainability condition 
(that the withdrawal rate of natural resources from the biosphere
is lower than the biosphere
replenishment rate).
Within industrial society,
the flow of short-lived goods 
(packaging,
paper products,
disposable tableware,
cutlery,
and napkins)
is large,
and, presumably, attaining a sustainable steady-state economy
will be difficult.
This definition of steady state 
$\left(\sum_{j}\frac{\mathrm{d}K_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t}=0\right)$
does not necessarily coincide with sustainability.

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:materials},
the rate of depreciation ($\gamma_{K}$) is inversely
proportional to the average lifetime of capital stock---as
the average lifetime of capital stock decreases,
the rate of depreciation of capital stock increases which
increases the draw on natural resources (by Equation~\ref{eq:C_CV_all_c}).
It is likely that the average lifetime of capital stock has
decreased over the last century, 
due to a decrease in durability of capital stock
(the average table built today is not as durable as the average table
built in the early twentieth century)
and also due to increasing proportions of consumer electronics
with short lifetimes (cell phones, laptops, tablets).
Decreasing lifetime causes higher rates of flow for
replacement materials.
In the absence of extreme recycling of materials,
these large replacement flows place large demands on
natural resources.

Thirdly,
the maintenance flows necessary to overcome
depreciation
$\left(\sum_{j}\gamma_{K_{j}}K_{j}\right)$
are proportional to the magnitude of the capital
stock ($K_{j}$).
As such,
a larger stock of capital requires
greater draw on natural resources and is thus harder
to maintain within any sustainability constraint.
These points emphasize that constant capital stock
(or analogously constant population)
is not a sufficient condition for environmental sustainability.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%+++++++++ Constant throughput ++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Constant material throughput}

Herman Daly has placed great emphasis on a steady-state
economy as having a constant rate of material throughput 
\cite{Daly1977, Daly1997}
which, as discussed above, should be below biophysical limits
if sustainability is to be achieved.
This is often referred to as the ``scale'' issue---how 
large is the (currently growing) human economy in relation
to the finite, non-growing biosphere of which it is a sub-system?
Growth of the human economy must either displace other natural
ecosystems (replacing old growth forest for crops)
or deplete natural capital stocks, be they 
renewable (fisheries) or 
non-renewable (fossil fuels).
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:C_materials},
material throughput is composed of two distinct processes:
exchange of material \emph{from} the biosphere 
\emph{into} the economy (extraction)
and exchange of material \emph{from} the economy
\emph{into} biosphere (waste and depreciation).
We may characterizing constant material throughput
as either constant rate of extraction, constant rate of
waste disposal, or both.
In the language of our framework, we could write:
**** I thought you wanted to use $\frac{\mathrm{d}\dot{R}_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t}$, etc. --MKH ****

\begin{align}\label{eq:const_throughput}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{R}_{0}\right)		&
	= 0																							\\
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{S}_{0}\right)		&
	= 0																						\\
	\sum\limits_{i}
			\left[
				\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{R}_{i0}\right)
				+ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{S}_{i0}\right)
				+ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{K}_{i0}\right)
			\right]																			&
	= 0.
\end{align}

The above equations say nothing about the level 
of man-made capital stock ($K$)
or the flow rate of short-lived goods ($\dot{S}$).
Thus, within the constant throughput constraint,
increasingly effective use of materials could
theoretically allow increasing accumulation
of man-made capital ($K$) 
and increasing flow of short-lived goods ($\dot{S}$)
as society learns to use resources better.
Eventually,
physical limits would entail that capital
stock could no longer be increased.
Presumably,
society would desire that the throughput of
materials would be within levels that could
be sustained by the biosphere,
both at the input side---natural 
resources extracted at rates lower
than natural regeneration rates---and 
at the output side---wastes emitted 
at rates below which
the biosphere can assimilate.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%+++++++++ Constant GDP ++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Constant GDP}

The issue of GDP and economic ``development'' 
has already been discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:implications_for_development}. 
However,
the case of zero growth in GDP was not.
Within our framework,
a condition of constant GDP would be
characterized by the following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:const_GDP}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(GDP\right)
	=	\sum\limits_{j}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\dot{X}_{j}\right)
	= 0
\end{equation}

Since,
under the subjective theory of value,
no value is attributed to the flow of materials
to or from the biosphere,
it is unclear what the impact constant GDP would be
on capital stock ($K$)
or material throughput
(extraction and waste disposal).
If we constrained $\dot{R}_{0}$ and
$\dot{S}_{0}$, it is 

**** carry on discussion---MCD ****

**** Becky, can you speak to this? ****

**** Discuss maintenance vs.\ accumulation flows? 
Is this a better place to discuss this issue? Can refer to
Section 6.5 and Odum B/P vs. P/B. ****

%****** Mik: Finish this section. 
%In terms of what a SSE would look like in the I-O framework, 
%at first blush, I would think that dB/dt = 0 is one aspect.  
%Also, with no growth, inflow rates = depreciation rates.  
%The larger that B is for any society, the larger E must be (to overcome depreciation).  
%To minimize E, hyper-recycling is probably useful.  
%Those are at least a place to start. ******
%
%****** In our discussion, 
%we also addressed the attempts at SSE from point of view of society. 
%In order to achieve this goal \emph{without} recycling, 
%the goods and services sector should have to increase extraction to offset decreasing ore grade, 
%the energy sector should have to increase extraction of energy 
%to allow increasing extraction (unless efficiency could make up the gap: unlikely) 
%in which case the SSE would be violated from these two and from the POV of the earth.

%%\paragraph{Paragraph Heading} %
%% Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

%% Note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

%% When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
