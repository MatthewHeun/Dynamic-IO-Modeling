Several implications can be drawn from the above detailed development of the I-O method equations in a manner that includes both embodied energy accumulation and depreciation.

\section{Implications for economic ``development''}
%%%%%%%%%%

[IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A COMPARISON BETWEEN $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ 
AND STANDARD METRIC OF DEVELOPMENT, 
I.E. GDP WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE $\sum_{i}\dot{X}_{i}$. 
WE CAN CERTAINLY ENVISION SITUATIONS WHERE $\sum_{i}\dot{X}_{i}$ IS INCREASING AND]

One consequence of economic ``progress'' or ``development'' is that embodied energy accumulates 
in economic sectors and society. 
In fact, accumulation of embodied energy in economic sectors and society 
could be considered a \emph{proxy} for development. 
This proxy for development is overly materialistic, one-dimensional, and reductionist, 
but alternatives such as GDP can be similarly criticized. 
In fact, GDP could continue to increase whilst accumulation 
of embodied energy or value actually decreased.

Figure~\ref{fig:total_energy_flows_2S} shows that energy extraction 
from the Earth is what ultimately drives development 
as measured by the accumulation of embodied energy in the economy and society. 
Development occurs over time. 
If embodied energy is the measure, 
development can be expressed as 
the integral of $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ for economic sectors

***************** Need to edit the following equations for index changes. ************

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Dev_Integral_Economy}
	\vec{B}(t) 
	= \vec{B}(0) 
	+ \int_{t=0}^{t=t} \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}

\noindent{}or, using Equation~\ref{eq:compare_demand_and_accumulation}, 
as the integral of $\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ for society,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Dev_Integral_Society}
	B_{2}(t) 
	= B_{2}(0) 
	+ \int_{t=0}^{t=t} \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t 
	= B_{2}(0) 
	+ \int_{t=0}^{t=t} (Y_{\dot{T}} 
	- \gamma_{2}B_{2} 
	- \dot{Q}_{21})\mathrm{d}t.
\end{equation}

%[I ADDED IN A $\dot{Q}_{21}$ TERM HERE - MD]

Using embodied energy is obviously an incomplete measure of development. 
We might also use $X(t) = X(0) + \int\frac{dX}{dt}dt$. 
In fact, B and X are two complimentary factors to the economic process. 
For capital, B, to be useful, we need direct energy, 
E (to run the capital) and economic value, X (i.e.\ currency). 
Therefore each of these factors are necessary, but insufficient.

Table~\ref{table:embodied_energy_accumulation_factors} 
describes some of the dynamics that can be observed from 
Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_leontief_with_A}. 
It is quite possible that, especially for regions like the U.S. and Western Europe, 
the rate of embodied energy accumulation in the economy 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
will be small relative to the rate of energy extraction 
from the Earth ($\vec{E}$). 
On the other hand, in rapidly developing countries, 
like China or India, the rate of embodied energy accumulation 
in the economy may be significantly higher than in a developed economy.

\begin{table}
\caption{Factors from Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_leontief_with_A} 
affecting the rate of embodied energy accumulation in the economy.}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c @{\hspace{2em}} l}
    \toprule
    Term & Implication \\ 
	\midrule
    $\hat{\vec{X}}$ & As economic output increases, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes up (as will $\vec{E})$  \\
    $\vec{A}$ & As input-ouput ratios increase, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes up  \\
    $\varepsilon$ & As the energy intensity of the economy increases, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes up  \\ 
   $ \vec{E}$ & As the rate of energy flow from the Earth increases, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes up  \\ 
    $\hat{\vec{\gamma}}$ & As the depreciation rate increases, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes down  \\ 
    $\vec{B}$ & As the embodied energy in the economy increases, $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ goes down  \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table:embodied_energy_accumulation_factors}
\end{table}

The behavior of $\vec{B}$ with $\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}$ 
is vitally important. 
A developed economy has significantly higher embodied energy ($\vec{B}$) 
than a developing economy, and, thus, 
the outflow rate of embodied energy 
due to depreciation ($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}$) will be higher. 
As increasingly large amounts of energy are embodied in the economy, 
increasingly large energy extraction rates ($\vec{E}$) 
are required to offset depreciation ($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}$) 
and maintain positive growth $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} > 0\right)$ 
in the sectors of the economy. 
Depreciation may also be, temporarily, 
offset by increasing energy efficiency, i.e.\ by decreasing energy intensity, $\varepsilon$.

In a similar manner, 
Equation~\ref{eq:compare_demand_and_accumulation} 
indicates that maintaining a positive rate of societal development 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} > 0\right)$ 
requires ever increasing embodied energy input rates 
to society ($Y_{\dot{T}}$) as the society ``develops.'' 
This mechanism provides a natural restraint
to the continued growth of physical economies.

\section{Implications for the I-O method}
%%%%%%%%%%

Equations~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief} and~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}
are two versions of the total energy 
accounting equation (Equation~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief_pre_2}).
It is clear that we can solve Equation~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief_pre_2} 
for either~(a)~the embodied energy accumulation
vector ($\vec{\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}}$) 
as in Equation~\ref{eq:matrix_leontief} 
or~(b)~the energy intensity vector ($\bm{\varepsilon}$) as in
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}, 
but not both.

******* Discuss similarities of the scalar and matrix
versions of the equations. ************

******** Discuss differences between Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}
and the literature. ***********

******** Discuss that I-O literature focused on estimating $\varepsilon$ *********

*********** Tie back to our discussion of value and the fact that
$\varepsilon$ is an interesting intrinsic measure of the 
output of an economic sector, even within the existing
subjective process of determining economic value that underlies
all economics. In other words, $\varepsilon$ doesn't 
need to be the basis for determining value for it to be an important
measure of economic activity. *********

**** The following equation references don't work, 
because I deleted the scalar version of the equation. 
Refer to the vector version instead. ****
Equation~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} is similar 
to the typical energy intensity equation 
found in the I-O literature~\cite[Equation 6, e.g.]{Casler1984},
with the following exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Equation~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} includes scalar terms, 
	but the I-O literature utilizes a matrix
	formulation (see Section~\ref{sec:C-intensity_and_matrix} below),}
	\item{Equation~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} includes a term for 
	energy input to the economy from society ($\dot{T}_{12}$), 
	but the I-O literature typically does not,}
	\item{Equation~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} includes a term for
	accumulation of embodied energy in the economy 
	$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$,
	but the I-O literature typically does not, and}
	\item{Equation~\ref{eq:eps3_ss_IO} includes a term for
	depreciation ($\gamma_{2}B_{2}$),
	but the I-O literature typically does not.}
\end{itemize}

The I-O literature (examples include Bullard (1975) and Cassler (1983)) 
****** Need real references here. *********
usually writes Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature}
	\vec{\varepsilon} 
	= {(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{T})}^{-1}\hat{\vec{X}}^{-1}\vec{E}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}It is clear from comparison 
of Equations\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} 
and~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature} 
that the literature is not accounting for accumulation of energy 
in the economic sectors $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$, 
nor does it account for physical depreciation ($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}$). 
To be precise, the literature assumes

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	+ \hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B} 
	= \vec{0}.
\end{equation}

Examining Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A}, 
we see that to the extent that 
$\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B} \ll \vec{E}$, 
estimates of energy intensity ($\vec{\varepsilon}$) 
obtained with the assumption of Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption} 
contain little error. 
However, when the sum of the accumulation and depreciation rates 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}\right)$ 
becomes significant relative to the rate of energy extracted 
from the Earth ($\vec{E}$), 
estimates of economic sector energy intensities ($\vec{\varepsilon}$) 
using the assumption of Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption} 
have a high-side bias (assuming that $\frac{dB}{dt} >0$ and $\gamma B > 0$). 
As discussed above, the assumption of Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption} 
can be violated in developing economies 
because accumulation $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
is large or in developed economies because depreciation ($\hat{\gamma}\vec{B}$) is large. 

The assumption of Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption} 
may cause another challenge for energy analysts. 
The I-O method is often used to estimate energy intensities 
for each sector of the economy ($\vec{\varepsilon}$) 
with Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_plus_gamma_zero_assumption}. 
With $\vec{\varepsilon}$ values in hand, 
one can estimate changes in energy demand from the Earth ($\vec{E}$) 
as the output of economic sectors ($\hat{\vec{X}}$) 
increases or decreases by solving 
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A_literature} for $\vec{E}$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E}
	\vec{E} 
	= \hat{\vec{X}}(\vec{I} 
	- \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})\vec{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}

When accumulation and depreciation terms are included, 
we see that the energy demands ($\vec{E}$) must be calculated differently. 
Solving Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_with_A} 
for $\vec{E}$ gives 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Leontief_solved_for_E_with_embodied_depreciation}
	\vec{E} = \hat{\vec{X}}(\vec{I} - \vec{A}^{\mathrm{T}})\varepsilon + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \hat{\gamma}\vec{B}\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent{}By comparing Equations~\ref{eq:Leontief_lit_solved_for_E} 
and~\ref{eq:Leontief_solved_for_E_with_embodied_depreciation}, 
we see that to the extent that 
accumulation $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
and depreciation ($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}$) 
are non-zero, 
estimates of energy demand are too low. 
If the sum of accumulation 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
and depreciation ($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}$) 
are small relative to total energy demand ($\vec{E}$), 
then neglecting these effects causes little error. 
Economies with fast growth rates 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
or large sizes ($\vec{B}$) 
are more likely to violate the typical assumptions in the literature.


%%%%%%%%%% Implications %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implications for recycling, reuse, and dematerialization}
%%%%%%%%%%

Dematerialization is the idea that economic activity can be unlinked 
from material or energy demands (UNEP, 2011) 
******** Get real reference ********. 
One of the primary methods for dematerializing an economy 
is reuse and recycling of materials. 
The impact of recycling can be seen in the I-O formulation 
only when depreciation and accumulation are included. 

One effect of recycling is to reduce the magnitude 
of the disposal rate 
($\hat{\vec{\gamma}}$). 
Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_leontief_with_A} indicates that 
recycling of material in an economy, 
thereby reducing $\hat{\vec{\gamma}}$, 
will slow the effect of depreciation 
$\left(\hat{\vec{\gamma}}\vec{B}\right)$ 
and put upward pressure on growth 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$. 

Recycling has a mixed effect on energy demand ($\vec{E}$). 
Because recycled material displaces newly-produced material 
in the economy and society, 
recycling will tend to reduce energy demand ($\vec{E}$). 
Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_leontief_with_A} indicates that 
this displacement effect will put downward pressure on growth 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$. 
However, recycling processes require energy to operate, 
thereby increasing energy demand ($\vec{E}$). 
Equation~\ref{eq:dB_dt_leontief_with_A} indicates that 
additional energy demand will put upward pressure on growth 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$. 

If recycling produces a net reduction in energy demand ($\vec{E}$), 
that is if the effect of displaced production dominates over the effect 
of energy consumed in recycling processes, 
the upward pressure on growth $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
from decrease in $\hat{\vec{\gamma}}$ and 
the downward pressure on growth from net reduction of $\vec{E}$ 
offset each other, 
the growth rate $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ 
will remain near zero, 
and total embodied energy $(\vec{B})$ will remain constant. 
In that scenario, dematerialization can develop: 
reduced material and energy input ($\vec{E}$) can be accompanied by 
no change in growth $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{B}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$.


%%%%%%%%%% Implications %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Comparison to a Steady-state Economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

****** Finish this section. 
In terms of what a SSE would look like in the I-O framework, 
at first blush, I would think that dB/dt = 0 is one aspect.  
Also, with no growth, inflow rates = depreciation rates.  
The larger that B is for any society, the larger E must be (to overcome depreciation).  
To minimize E, hyper-recycling is probably useful.  
Those are at least a place to start. ******

****** In our discussion, 
we also addressed the attempts at SSE from point of view of society. 
In order to achieve this goal \emph{without} recycling, 
the goods and services sector should have to increase extraction to offset decreasing ore grade, 
the energy sector should have to increase extraction of energy 
to allow increasing extraction (unless efficiency could make up the gap: unlikely) 
in which case the SSE would be violated from these two and from the POV of the earth.
