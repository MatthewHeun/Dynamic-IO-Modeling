%%%%%%%%%% Energy Input Vector %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Choice of Energy Input Vector}
%%%%%%%%%%

Consistent with traditional I-O methods, 
the derivation presented above counts energy at the point of inflow to the economy. 
That is, elements of the energy input vector to the economy
($\vec{E}$) are zero except for those sectors 
that receive energy directly from the Earth. 
With the traditional approach, 
energy input to energy sectors is non-zero, 
and energy input to non-energy sectors is zero. 
So, in the two-sector example C above, 
$\dot{E}_{14} = 0$ and $\dot{E}_{13} \neq 0$. 

Costanza (1984) suggests an alternative approach, 
namely to count energy input to the economy 
at the point of conversion to useful work. 
Theoretical justification for this direct energy conversion~(DEC) 
approach comes from both thermodynamic and economic considerations. 
The thermodynamic justification derives from the purpose 
of energy consumption in an economy, 
namely to produce useful work. 
If energy flows \emph{through} a sector, 
it should not be counted ``against" that sector: 
only energy that is converted to useful work \emph{in} 
the sector should be counted against that sector.

The economic justification derives 
from the typical treatment of transportation sectors of the economy. 
****** More here. See Costanza (1984) for the transportation analogy. ******

The DEC approach implicitly redefines energy intensity 
to be the required amount of fossil fuel energy to produce a unit of economic output. 

****** Equation redefining $\varepsilon$ here.

In the DEC approach, 
electricity consumption is converted to its fossil energy equivalent~(coal) 
before being ``applied" to an economic sector. 
And, refined petroleum is converted to its fossil energy equivalent~(crude) 
before being ``applied" to an economic sector.

****** The DEC option is akin to my idea of substituting the 
1st Law into the total energy equation. 
Show this derivation after redefining $\varepsilon$ 
to be embodied energy per dollar, not total energy per dollar. 
So, there is a second implicit assumption in Costanza (1984), 
namely that we have a re-derivation of energy intensity. ******

****** Show that re-derivation results in 
only counting the energy burned by each sector 
(or the waste heat off of each sector). 
Costanza (1984) shows that distributing energy input 
at the point of consumption reduces the variance 
of energy intensity across all sectors of the economy. ******


%%%%%%%%%% Endogenous %%%%%%%%%%
\section{What is Endogenous?}
%%%%%%%%%%

Are government and households endogenous? 
Costanza (1980) was the first to endogenize government and households, 
because households provide services to the economy (labor) 
in exchange for wages and government provides services 
to the economy in exchange for taxes, both of which require energy. 
Costanza (1980) showed that by including government and households 
as sectors in the economy, 
the variation of energy intensity is significantly reduced 
across all sectors of the economy. 


%%%%%%%%%% The Sun %%%%%%%%%%
\section{What About the Sun?}
%%%%%%%%%%

Costanza (1980) includes an option to consider 
the sun as an input to the economy, 
thereby significantly increasing the energy intensity 
of agricultural sectors and other sectors 
that depend upon agricultural outputs, 
however Costanza (1984) did not include 
the sun \cite{Costanza1980,Costanza1984}. 
Whether solar input to the economy 
should be considered is probably dependent upon 
the objectives of the analysis. 
In this framework, we are primarily interested 
in the effects of declining energy resource quality in industrial economies, 
due to depletion of fossil fuels. 
As such, inclusion of solar flows is unnecessary. 
However, expanding the framework to include non-industrial 
or more agrarian societies would probably require accounting for these flows. 
Additionally, similar concerns might be raised 
in dealing with a society that is largely reliant on solar or wind energy.   
[EARLIER FOOTNOTE ON INDUSTRIAL VS. 
NON-INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES COULD BE BROUGHT IN HERE - MD]

There are a number of means by which solar flows can be accounted. 
Short-term solar flows could be accounted 
in the output of agricultural and forestry sectors, 
as well as some of the renewable energy producers, 
such as solar thermal and PV, 
wind, 
ocean thermal, 
hydro-power, and 
biomass. 
This method does not account for longer-term flows 
of solar energy used to form fossil fuels. 
The \emph{emergy} accounting method puts all flows 
in terms of \emph{em}bodied en\emph{ergy} flows~\cite{Odum1975, Odum1996}. 
The basic unit of measure is 
the \emph{em}joule which is often given in terms 
of flows of solar energy embodied in 
the energy (or material) - the solar emjoules - per unit of resource, 
abbreviated to seJ/J for energy resources, 
or seJ/g for materials. 
As such, even fossil fuels, e.g.\ coal, 
extracted from the earth have an embodied energy 
of around 67,000 seJ/J \cite{Brown2004}.
