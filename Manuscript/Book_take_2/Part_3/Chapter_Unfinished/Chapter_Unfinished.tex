With any endeavor of this size, 
namely development and comprehensive presentation 
of a framework for counting 
material, energy, and economic value in economies,
unfinished business is inevitable. 
This chapter discusses several 
practical, conceptual, and theoretical issues
that should be addressed in the future.


%%%%%%%%%% Data %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data}
\label{sec:Data}
%%%%%%%%%%

At several points in this manuscript,
we have noted the very practical issue of the
need for additional data, information, and analysis.
In particular, Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity} identified the need
for a method of independently determining of the rate of embodied energy 
accumulation in capital stock for the purposes of 
estimating the energy intensity of economic products,
especially for rapidly industrializing economies.
Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity} also noted the need to collect
data on human and draught animal physical work input to 
sectors of economies, espeically for those economies where 
muscle work is on the same order of magnitude 
as fossil fuel energy input.

Unfortunately, the U.S.\ stopped collecting 
satellite account data in 2000. 
Beyond the U.S., few countries collect and disseminate
the kind of data required as inputs to the framework
developed herein.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, we indicated that this book was 
about ``counting'' materials, energy, and value 
as each flows through economies.  
Unfortunately, unless data on these flows 
is collected and disseminated routinely, 
such counting is impossible.
The adage ``you can't control what you don't measure''
seems appropriate here. 
As the world confronts significant challenges
of material and energy supplies in the coming years,
it will be impossible to make wise decisions about
which materials to use,
which energy sources to develop, and 
which products to incentivize.

Another adage, ``we count what we value and we value what we count,''
points out that we are not presently valuing highly enough
the important flows of which our economies are comprised.
We add our voices to those encouraging governments and 
institutions to collect high-quality data on material 
and energy flows.
**** Becky, are there references that call for a renewed focus on 
collecting satellite account data? 
We should point to those references here. ****
 
**** Becky: review the above paragraphs.
Can you provide additional context on the decision
to stop this data collection? ****


%%%%%%%%%% Metabolic Economy Models %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Models and frameworks for the metabolic economy}
\label{sec:metabolic_models}
%%%%%%%%%%

**** Mik and Becky: please review and comment on this section. --Matt ****
Historically, mainstream economists have used the metaphor of ``machine''
to describe economies. 
In fact, much of mathematical economic modeling today 
relies upon mechanistic conceptual foundations whose roots 
are in Newtonian physics and the enlightenment.\footnote{The subfield 
of longwave economic growth modeling, in particular, 
uses mechanistic language to describe their equations. 
For example, Jones \cite[pp. 6 \& 18]{Jones:2001wn} 
refers to the ordinary differential equations 
that describe births, deaths, and the production of ideas
as ``laws of motion.''}
If your metahpor is a machine, it makes sense to analyze economies
with equations that describe machines.
In the mainstream, such equations usually, but not exclusively or restrictively,
are developed assuming that the economic machine is a ``closed'' system.

In this book, we take the strong position that economies are
better-represented as organic metabolisms.
Many ecological economists, 
who are predisposed to view the economy as a metabolism,
reject the use of mechanistic equations 
to describe the economy, in part because such equations often assume a 
machine that operates independently from the biosphere.
However, it doesn't have to be this way.
We say that it is not the use of equations themselves that is the problem.
Rather, it is the application of such equations with the assumption of a closed system
that is is worthy of criticism.

Thus, our approach herein includes rigorous application of the 
accounting equations for materials, energy, embodied energy, and economic value
\emph{under the assumption of} and \emph{including} 
vigorous and necessary interactions between
the economy and the biosphere.

It is our hope that this book will allow

\begin{itemize}
	\item{mainstream economists to see 
	that interaction between 
	the economy and the biosphere is both important 
	and possible to include in mechanistic models and}
	\item{ecological economists to see that mathematical modeling
	is an important tool for understanding interactions
	between the economy and the biosphere.}
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we encourage both mainstream and ecological economists
to embrace mathematical modeling of 
material, 
energy, 
embodied energy, 
and economic value flows
through the economy as a valid method of inquiry for modern economics.

%%%%%%%%%% Make-Use %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Extend framework for multiple outputs}
\label{sec:make-use}
%%%%%%%%%%

The intersection between our materials, energy, and value accounting framework 
and the I-O literature has been developed under the assumption 
that each economic sector makes a single product ($\dot{P}$).
In particular, the matrix mathematics of Chapter~\ref{chap:intensity}
relies heavily on this assumption 
from the early days of the I-O method.\cite{Bullard:1978vd}
However, the I-O method has been extended 
in the literature to include
multiple products for each economic sector.\cite{Costanza:1984tq,Casler1984} 
To do so, both ``make'' and ``use'' data are employed.

We decided to leverage the older,
single-product formulation of the I-O method
for the purposes of simplicity. 
The materials, energy, and value accounting framework
presented herein is more easily understood 
without the complexity of the ``make-use'' formulation 
of the I-O method.
However, work remains to adapt the materials and energy framework
to the ``make-use'' formulation of the I-O method.


%%%%%%%%%% Energy Input Vector %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Choice of energy input vector}
\label{sec:energy_input_vector}
%%%%%%%%%%

Consistent with traditional I-O methods, 
the derivation of the materials, energy, and value framework
presented herein counts energy at the point of inflow to the economy. 
That is, elements of the energy input vector to the economy
($\vec{E}_{0}$) are zero except for those sectors 
that receive energy directly from the Earth. 
So, in Figure~\ref{fig:C_energy} from Example~C, 
$\dot{E}_{03} = 0$ and $\dot{E}_{02} \ge 0$. 

Costanza (1984) suggests an alternative approach, 
namely to count energy input to the economy 
at the point of conversion to useful work. 
Theoretical justification for Costanza's Direct Energy Conversion~(DEC) 
approach comes from both thermodynamic and economic considerations. 
The thermodynamic justification derives from the purpose 
of energy consumption in an economy, 
namely to produce useful work. 
If energy flows \emph{through} a sector, 
it should not be counted ``against'' that sector: 
only energy that is converted to useful work \emph{within} 
a sector should be counted against that sector.
The economic justification derives 
from the typical treatment of transportation sectors of the economy.
Costanza notes:

\begin{quote}
	The primary energy sectors functions are like the transportation sectors, 
	which alse require special treatment in I-O analysis 
	based on the difference between the services they provide 
	and their physical inputs and outputs. 
	If a strictly physical interpretation were applied to the transportation sectors, 
	they would receive almost all goods produced in the whole economy as inputs 
	and redistribute them as output, 
	masking information on transfers of goods between sectors. 
	For this reason, the transportation sectors in I-O analysis 
	are thought of as providing transportation services 
	that are purchased by the producing sector, 
	preserving the connection between the producing and consuming sector 
	but adding a `transportation margin.' 
	For analogous reasons, 
	the primary energy sectors should be thought of as providing a 
	`transportation service' in moving primary energy 
	from nature to the consuming sectors. 
	The DEC energy input vector incorporates this interpretation.\cite{Costanza:1984tq}
\end{quote}

The DEC approach implicitly redefines energy intensity ($\bm{\varepsilon}$)
to be the consumed amount of fossil fuel energy to produce a unit of economic output. 

****** Equation redefining $\varepsilon$ here.

In the DEC approach, 
electricity consumption is converted to its fossil energy equivalent~(coal) 
before being ``applied'' to an economic sector. 
And, refined petroleum is converted to its fossil energy equivalent~(crude) 
before being ``applied'' to an economic sector.

****** The DEC option is akin to my idea of substituting the 
1st Law into the total energy equation. 
Show this derivation after redefining $\varepsilon$ 
to be embodied energy per dollar, not total energy per dollar. 
So, there is a second implicit assumption in Costanza (1984), 
namely that we have a re-derivation of energy intensity. ******

****** Show that re-derivation results in 
only counting the energy burned by each sector 
(or the waste heat off of each sector). 
Costanza (1984) shows that distributing energy input 
at the point of consumption reduces the variance 
of energy intensity across all sectors of the economy. ******


%%%%%%%%%% Endogenous %%%%%%%%%%
\section{What is Endogenous?}
%%%%%%%%%%

Are government and households endogenous? 
Costanza (1980) was the first to endogenize government and households, 
because households provide services to the economy (labor) 
in exchange for wages and government provides services 
to the economy in exchange for taxes, both of which require energy. 
Costanza (1980) showed that by including government and households 
as sectors in the economy, 
the variation of energy intensity is significantly reduced 
across all sectors of the economy. 

**** Idea: Re-derive the energy intensity equation,
Equation~\ref{eq:epsilon_leontief_depreciation_simplification},
including Final Demand (1). ****


%%%%%%%%%% The Sun %%%%%%%%%%
\section{What About the Sun?}
%%%%%%%%%%

Costanza (1980) includes an option to consider 
the sun as an input to the economy, 
thereby significantly increasing the energy intensity 
of agricultural sectors and other sectors 
that depend upon agricultural outputs, 
however Costanza (1984) did not include 
the sun.~\cite{Costanza:1980ww,Costanza:1984tq}
Whether solar input to the economy 
should be considered is probably dependent upon 
the objectives of the analysis. 
In this framework, we are primarily interested 
in the effects of declining energy resource quality in industrial economies, 
due to depletion of fossil fuels. 
As such, inclusion of solar flows is unnecessary. 
However, expanding the framework to include non-industrial 
or more agrarian societies would probably require accounting for these flows. 
Additionally, similar concerns might be raised 
in dealing with a society that is largely reliant on solar or wind energy.   
[EARLIER FOOTNOTE ON INDUSTRIAL VS.\ 
NON-INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES COULD BE BROUGHT IN HERE---MD]

There are a number of means by which solar flows can be accounted. 
Short-term solar flows could be accounted 
in the output of agricultural and forestry sectors, 
as well as some of the renewable energy producers, 
such as solar thermal and PV, 
wind, 
ocean thermal, 
hydro-power, and 
biomass. 
This method does not account for longer-term flows 
of solar energy used to form fossil fuels. 
The \emph{emergy} accounting method puts all flows 
in terms of \emph{em}bodied en\emph{ergy} flows.~\cite{Odum1975, Odum1996}
The basic unit of measure is 
the \emph{em}joule which is often given in terms 
of flows of solar energy embodied in 
the energy (or material)---the solar emjoules---per unit of resource, 
abbreviated to seJ/J for energy resources, 
or seJ/g for materials. 
As such, even fossil fuels, e.g.\ coal, 
extracted from the earth have an embodied energy 
of around 67,000~seJ/J.~\cite{Brown2004}
