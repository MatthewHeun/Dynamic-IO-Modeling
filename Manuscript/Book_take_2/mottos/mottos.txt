INTRODUCTION

Where there is no reliable accounting 
and therefore no competent knowledge
of the economic and ecological effects of our lives,
we cannot live lives that are economically
and ecologically responsible.
**** Do we have a citation for this? ****

\hfill---\emph{Wendell Berry}


MATERIALS

Well, I have my rights, sir, 
and I’m telling you I intend to go on doing just what I do!

ENERGY

Living organisms need to be open to a constant flow of resources (energy and matter) to stay alive; human organizations need to be open to a flow of mental resources (information and ideas), as well as to the flows of energy and materials that are part of the production of goods or services.

EMBODIED ENERGY

One of the main sinks of energy in the “developed” world is the creation of stuff. In its natural life cycle, stuff passes through three stages. First, a new-born stuff is displayed in shiny packaging on a shelf in a shop. At this stage, stuff is called “goods.” As soon as the stuff is taken home and sheds its packaging, it undergoes a transformation from “goods” to its second form, “clutter.” The clutter lives with its owner for a period of months or years. During this period, the clutter is largely ignored by its owner, who is off at the shops buying more goods. Eventually, by a miracle of modern alchemy, the clutter is transformed into its final form, rubbish. To the untrained eye, it can be difficult to distinguish this “rubbish” from the highly desirable “good” that it used to be. Nonetheless, at this stage the discerning owner pays the dustman to transport the stuff away.

VALUE

We try to measure what we value. 
We come to value what we measure.

\hfill---\emph{Donella Meadows~\cite[p.~2]{Meadows:1998aa}}


ENERGY INTENSITY

We have the most crude accounting tools. 
It's tragic because our accounts and our national arithmetic 
doesn't tell us the things that we need to know.

IMPLICATIONS

**** Which do we want? ****
Ugh. The only published, page numbered account is by rfk jr in the forward to 
Senator Gaylor Nelsons' book. He doesn't attribute the quote to anyone.

The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment.

SUMMARY

Only a crisis---actual or perceived---produces real change. 
When that crisis occurs, the actions that are 
taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.

BOOKEND?

If we apply our minds directly and competently to the needs of the earth, 
then we will have begun to make fundamental and necessary changes in our minds. 
We will begin to understand and to mistrust and to change our wasteful economy, 
which markets not just the produce of the earth, 
but also the earth's ability to produce. 
We will see that beauty and utility are alike dependent upon the health of the world. 
But we will also see through the fads and the fashions of protest. 
We will see that war and oppression and pollution are not separate issues, 
but are aspects of the same issue. 
Amid the outcries for the liberation of this group or that, 
we will know that no person is free except in the freedom of other persons, 
and that man's only real freedom 
is to know and faithfully occupy his place---a much humbler place 
than we have been taught to think---in the order of creation.

The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream 



Markets can't think about anything beyond about three months. 
This is very long-term for markets, 
which is why the important things in life 
have got to be taken outside of the marketplace.
Susan George

The natural capital is not income, 
but we spend our natural capital as if it were revenue, 
as if it were going to come back next year without any problems, 
whereas these renewals in nature can take hundreds of years.
Susan George

Maybe just the last part from the G-R quote:
"[Only economists still put the cart before the horse 
by claiming that the growing turmoil of mankind can be 
eliminated if prices are right. 
The truth is that]... 
only if our values are right will prices also be so."
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen  

“Anyone who believes in indefinite growth in anything physical, 
on a physically finite planet, 
is either mad or an economist.”
