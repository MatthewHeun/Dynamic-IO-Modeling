In the Introduction, we introduced the idea that economies are
in many ways like organisms. The job of this chapter is to explore
this idea further by observing the interchange of materials \emph{within}
an economy, as well as exchanges of materials between an economy and 
surrounding environment---the biosphere.

There are many easily observable instances of material flow within an
economy. I look around my office at my computer screen and coffee cup
and myriad other items. I look out my window to the street and building
opposite. All of these goods came originally from natural resources, be it paper or
petroleum or rock. They were extracted and processed, transported and
transformed requiring yet more materials and energy inputs in the form of
electricity or fuels. 

There are also inumerable material flows caused by an economy that we do not observe.
The extraction of raw materials generates additional overburden---earth that must be
extracted and processed and ultimately discarded without ever entering the economy proper.
Other flows occur around us unseen. The cars outside my window suck in nitrogen and oxygen (without which
the engine would not work) and emit water, carbon dioxide and other more harmful substances. 

Even services which we tend to think of as non-material, require at least some material infrastructure. 
The hairdresser requires scissors (and to a greater or lesser extent some hair) with which to work.
Even the internet, often lauded as the exemplar of dematerialization of the economic process, requires
a whole host of computer infrastructure including electricity, data servers, telephone networks and a
computer by which to access it.

In this chapter, we will define a mathematical framework by which to track the flow of materials
within an economy, building from a one-sector economy up to examples of both a two- and 
three-sector economy. We will finally apply this framework to the illustrative example of the US
automobile industry that runs through the whole book. First let us outline the basic methodology.

\section{Methodology}

We are all familiar with the notion of accounting of material (and even non-material) entities. In order
to be rigorous, the first step requires the definition of what we will be counting as well as the place
(defined in both time and space) for which we will be counting. Engineers often call this a \emph{control volume}.
For example, I may wish to account the number of apples in my home over a week-long period. In which case,
I would count the number of apples that enter  and leave my home, as well as any apples that are eaten and, just 
in case I happen to have an apple tree, any apples that grow inside my home. Our accounting equation would look
something like:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta\textrm{apples} = \textrm{apples in} - \textrm{apples out} + \textrm{apples grown} - \textrm{apples eaten}
\end{equation}

\noindent More generally, we may say:

\begin{equation}
	\textrm{Accumulation}
	= \textrm{Transfers in} 
	- \textrm{Transfers out}
	+ \textrm{Creation}
	- \textrm{Destruction}
\end{equation}

Instead of looking at the total amount of apples over our week-long period, we may instead be interested in the
flow of apples, $A$, per unit time, e.g. apples per day, in which case our accounting equation would look like:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{A}_{in}
	- \dot{A}_{out}
	+ \dot{A}_{grown}
	- \dot{A}_{eaten}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the dot above the variable simply means the flow rate per unit time and $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}$
is the rate of change of accumulation.

In the discussion that follows, we will be making great use of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is a
fancy way of saying that, when we discuss \emph{mass}, i.e. materials, and \emph{energy} the First Law tells
us that these can neither be created or destroyed. In other words, the last two terms of our accounting
equation will always be equal to zero. We also distinguish between three different types of materials flowing
into or out of a production sector: resources (R), short-lived goods (S) and capital goods (K), as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}

Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution.
