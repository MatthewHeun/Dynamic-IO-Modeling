\abstract*{In this chapter, we develop equations, 
assisted by the First Law of Thermodynamics,
that describe the flow of 
direct energy through economies.
The equations are applied to
example economies with increasing levels of disaggregation. 
Finally, the energy flows for our running example, the US auto industry,
are discussed.}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, we formulated a model of economies
consisting of producers and consumers who exchange
goods and services and factors of production 
while extracting resources and disposing of wastes. 
In Chapter~\ref{chap:materials}, we established the material basis of economies: 
economies are analogous to organisms with metabolisms that processes
raw resources for the benefit of producers and consumers 
while generating unavoidable wastes.
In this chapter, we describe and analyze the 
direct energy
that is associated with material flows
through an economy.

All forms of energy provide the potential to do mechanical work.\footnote{The 
quantification of the mechanical work potential of energy is \emph{exergy}.
When energy is ``consumed'' by an economy, exergy (work potential) is destroyed.
These topics are discussed in greater detail in Section~\ref{sec:material_quality}.}
Energy (as mechanical work) 
is an essential aspect of the metabolic economy;
with it, materials are refined, shaped, and assembled
into useful intermediate and final products; 
food is made available to people in society; 
jobs are made easier for workers;
human ingenuity is multiplied;
and complex systems and civilizations are possible.
In the absence of high rates of energy availablity at low cost,
life becomes much more difficult, even impossible, for many people.

The analogy for this chapter is this: 
energy is to thermodynamics as money is to financial accounting.
Or, energy is the \emph{currency of thermodynamics}.
Just as an accountant understands a firm by watching how and where
currency flows through it, so we can understand an economy by watching
how and where energy flows through it.
Accounting for energy flows through an economy
is essential for developing a dynamic picture 
of its metabolism.

The purpose of this chapter is to develop 
a framework for accounting energy flows within economies.
With an energy model in hand, we will be positioned 
to assess the rate at which
consumed direct energy becomes embodied within the products and 
services that an economy provides
(Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}).


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:energy_methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%

We begin by noting that direct energy travels 
with material through an economy.
``Direct'' energy refers to forms of energy accounted by the 
First Law of Thermodynamics,
including chemical potential energy, 
nuclear potential energy, 
gravitational potential energy,
thermal energy, 
and kinetic energy.
We use the term ``direct'' energy distinct from ``embodied'' energy, 
which will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.
Examples of direct energy flows include 
the chemical potential energy of coal inflows to an energy sector, 
the thermal energy of process steam into a textile plant, and
the thermal energy of CO$_2$ automobile exhaust.
Each of these example flows is an example of a ``transfer in''
or a ``transfer out,'' in the language % chktex 38
of Section~\ref{sec:accounting_in_everyday_life}.
In each case, the material (coal, steam, and CO$_2$) 
carries direct energy with it.
Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content} shows a corresponding 
direct energy flow for each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering\
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_1/Chapter_Energy/images/PERKS_basic_unit_energy_content.pdf}
\caption[Energy content of material flows for a single sector]{Energy content ($\dot{E}$) of material flows 
($\dot{R}$, $\dot{S}$, and $\dot{K}$) 
from Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_materials}.}
\label{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
\end{figure}

For any boundary (around, say, a machine, a plant,
a sector of the economy, or the entire economy itself), 
the First Law of Thermodynamics says that 
the accumulation rate 
of direct energy within the 
boundary $\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
is equal to the sum of the incoming and outgoing direct energy transfer 
rates ($\dot{E}$)
less outflowing energy carried by wastes 
($\dot{Q}_{out}$). 
Energy is conserved: it be neither created nor destroyed.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_with_accumulation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sum \dot{E} - \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

When there is no accumulation of direct energy within the boundary
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \right)$, the sum of all 
signed direct energy flow rates ($\dot{E}$) 
and waste heats ($\dot{Q}_{out}$) will be zero.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:First_Law_no_accumulation}
	0 = \sum \dot{E} - \sum \dot{Q}_{out}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the direct energy associated with some material flows can
be so small as to be negligible compared to other direct energy flows in the economy.
For example, there is a small amount of chemical energy in steel that could be
released upon combustion. 
However, the direct energy associated flows of steel within the economy
is almost negligible. (The \emph{embodied} energy of the steel is most certainly
\emph{not} negligible, as will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.)
On the other hand, the direct energy flow rates for 
fossil fuels
(coal, oil, and natural gas)
are typically orders of magnitude larger than any other 
material flows due to large chemical potential energy content.

To simplify the direct energy analysis, 
we can aggregate the direct energy flows of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}
into single arrows when appropriate. 
For example, the direct energy inputs from other sectors of the economy
(labeled as $\dot{E}_{\dot{R}}$, $\dot{E}_{\dot{S}}$, and $\dot{E}_{\dot{K}}$ 
at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_content}) can be summed to $\dot{E}$ 
(in Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy}) such that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:direct_energy_aggregation}
	\dot{E} 
	= \dot{E}_{\dot{R}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{S}} 
	+ \dot{E}_{\dot{K}}.
\end{equation}

\label{fig:PERKS_energy}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example A: single-sector economy} % chktex 13
\label{sec:A_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

Aggregated direct energy flows are now applied to Example A, 
the single-sector economy shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}.
By summing the direct energy flows associated with
each material flow of Figure~\ref{fig:A_materials}, we obtain
a simplified picture of direct energy flows in the economy,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_1/Chapter_Energy/images/1_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption[Direct energy flows a one-sector economy]{Direct energy flows ($\dot{E}$) a one-sector economy.}
\label{fig:A_energy}
\end{figure}

We distinguish useful direct energy inputs to a sector of the economy
($\dot{E}_{01}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}) from wasteful direct energy flows 
($\dot{Q}_{10}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}), 
because $\dot{Q}$ typically denotes thermal energy, 
and most waste energy is in the form of thermal
energy, i.e., waste heat. In Figure~\ref{fig:A_energy}, direct energy input to the 
economy ($\dot{E}_{01}$) is shown as being extracted from the biosphere, because
the vast majority of direct energy today is derived from fossil fuels.
Waste heat from the economy ($\dot{Q}_{10}$) is shown as returning 
to the biosphere.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:energy_methodology}, 
both direct energy ($\dot{E}$), and waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) 
are accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. 
Accounting for possible accumulation of direct energy, 
the First Law of Thermodynamics for Example~A indicates that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_0/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_0}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	- \dot{E}_{01}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_1/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{01} 
	+ \dot{E}_{11}
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

Note that $\dot{E}_{1}$ is the gross direct energy production rate
of society. 
For example, firms extract crude oil (a component of $\dot{E}_{01}$) 
and refine it into petroleum products (a component of $\dot{E}_{1}$)
that are consumed by society.
The direct energy consumption of extraction and refining firms 
is a component of $\dot{E}_{11}$.

Aside from, for example, the US 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 
we are not stockpiling oil and coal at any meaningful rate, 
i.e.\ we consume fossil fuels at a rate equal to their extraction rate. 
Thus, the world is not accumulating direct energy 
in the economy.\footnote{A counter-example could be made 
for nuclear fuels where ``spent'' fuel represents a large exergetic stockpile. 
However, this reserve is not (presently) economically useful.} 
(The world \emph{is}, however, 
accumulating \emph{embodied} energy
in the economy as we shall see 
in Chapter~\ref{chap:embodied_energy}.) 
Thus, the accumulation rates for direct energy 
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ in the above equations 
could be set to zero as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:biosphere_direct_energy_steady_state}
	0 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	- \dot{E}_{01}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_direct_energy_steady_state}
	0 
	= \dot{E}_{01} 
	+ \dot{E}_{11}
	- \dot{E}_{1} 
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}However, we shall see later (in Chapter~\ref{chap:direct_energy}) 
that keeping direct energy accumulation terms
$\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$ 
provides an advantage when deriving embodied energy accounting equations.


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example B %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example B: two-sector economy} % chktex 13
\label{sec:B_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

For Example~B, we split a Production sector (2) from 
society (1). Figure~\ref{fig:B_energy} shows aggregated
direct energy flows associated with the material flows of Figure~\ref{fig:B_materials}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Part_1/Chapter_Energy/images/2_sector_direct_energy.pdf}
\caption[Direct energy flows for a two-sector economy]{Direct energy flows ($\dot{E}$) for a two-sector economy.}
\label{fig:B_energy}
\end{figure}

The First Law of Thermodynamics
requires that both 
direct energy and 
waste heat
be conserved around each 
entity (1 and 2) as well as around the biosphere (0).

\noindent{}First Law energy accounting around the biosphere (0) and society (1) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_0}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{20} 
	- \dot{E}_{02},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{11} 
	+ \dot{E}_{21}
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10}.
\end{equation}

Note that $\dot{E}_{12}$ represents useful work that people
and draught animals contribute to Production (2). 
Ayres and Warr~\cite{Ayres:2003ec,Warr:2012cg} call this ``muscle work.'' 
$\dot{E}_{11}$ represents the muscle work required for consumption. 
Direct energy (electricity, oil, natural gas, etc.) 
required for consumption by final demand 
is included in $\dot{E}_{21}$.

The First Law around Production (2), 
including the accumulation rate of direct energy in the sector 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$, yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_dot_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{02} 
	+ \dot{E}_{12}
	+ \dot{E}_{22} 
	- \dot{E}_{2} 
	- \dot{Q}_{20}.
\end{equation}

\noindent It is notable that Production (2) consumes ($\dot{E}_{22}$)
a portion of its gross energy output ($\dot{E}_2$): \emph{it takes energy to make energy}.
The gross direct energy production of the energy sector (2) is 
$\dot{E}_{2}$, and the direct energy consumption of the energy sector (2) is 
$\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22}$. 
The net direct energy production by the energy sector (2)
is given by $\dot{E}_{2} - (\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22})$.
The \emph{energy return on investment}
($EROI$) of the energy sector (2) is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-EROI}
	EROI_{2} 
	= \frac{\dot{E}_{2}}{\dot{E}_{12} + \dot{E}_{22}}.
\end{equation}

\noindent{}EROI represents the energy production \emph{per unit} of energy
invested by society in the production process and may
be considered a measure of the ease of obtaining
energy resources from the biosphere.\footnote{Although
	the definition of EROI, as outlined here, 
	is easy to articulate 
	$\left( \mathrm{essentially,} \: \frac{\mathrm{energy~out}}{\mathrm{energy~in}} \right)$,
	the EROI
	calculation involves a multitude of system boundary
	considerations.
	These issues are well covered by both Murphy, et al.~\cite{Murphy2011}
	and Brandt, et al.~\cite{Brandt2011a, Brandt2013} who outline varying
	EROI
	ratios according to what factors are included in the calculation.
	Because we are dealing only with direct energy in this chapter
	(and not upstream energy embodied in materials),
	the EROI
	defined here is EROI$_{2,d}$~\cite[Table~1]{Murphy2011}
	or GER$_{\gamma}$~\cite[Table~1]{Brandt2011},
	where GER stands for \emph{gross energy ratio}
	an equivalent metric to EROI\@.
	Possible implications of declining EROI
	are discussed in more
	detail in Section~\ref{sec:resource_quality_and_irreversibility}.

Equation~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_0} can be generalized with a sum as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:CV_E_biosphere_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left( \dot{Q}_{i0} - \dot{E}_{0i} \right),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the number of economic sectors in the model
(in this example, $n = 2$).
Similarly, Equations~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_1}~and~\ref{eq:CV_E_dot_2} 
can generalized with a sum as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:B-CV_E_econ_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=0}^n\dot{E}_{ij} 
	- \dot{E}_{j}  
	- \dot{Q}_{j0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j \in [1, n]$.


%%%%%%%%%% Energy: Example C %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example C: three-sector economy} % chktex 13
\label{sec:C_energy}
%%%%%%%%%%

We can extend Example~B, to include an energy sector (2) 
and a goods and services sector (3), thereby obtaining
a fuller picture of direct energy flows among sectors
(Figure~\ref{fig:C_energy}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption[Direct energy flows for a three-sector economy]{Direct energy flows ($\dot{E}$) for a three-sector economy.}
\label{fig:C_energy}
\end{figure}

The First Law of Thermodynamics around the 
biosphere (0), society (1), and the energy sector (2) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_0}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{Q}_{10} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{20} 
	+ \dot{Q}_{30} 
	- \dot{E}_{02} 
	- \dot{E}_{03},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_1}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	= \dot{E}_{11}
	+ \dot{E}_{21}  
	+ \dot{E}_{31} 
	- \dot{E}_{1}
	- \dot{Q}_{10},
\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_2}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \dot{E}_{02} 
	+ \dot{E}_{12}
	+ \dot{E}_{22} 
	+ \dot{E}_{32} 
	- \dot{E}_{2} 
	- \dot{Q}_{20}.
\end{equation}

The First Law around the goods and services sector (3) including, 
for now, the accumulation rate of direct energy in the sector 
$\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_dot_3}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{3}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \dot{E}_{03} 
	+ \dot{E}_{13}
	+ \dot{E}_{23} 
	+ \dot{E}_{33} 
	- \dot{E}_3 
	- \dot{Q}_{30}.
\end{equation}

Similar to Example~B, we can generalize 
Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_0}--\ref{eq:C-CV_E_dot_3}
with sums to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_biosphere_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{0}}{\mathrm{d}t} 	 
	= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{Q}_{i0} - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dot{E}_{0i}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{j}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
	= \sum\limits_{i=0}^n\dot{E}_{ij} 
	- \dot{E}_{j}  
	- \dot{Q}_{j0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j \in [1, n]$. 
Equations~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_biosphere_general} and 
\ref{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general} are identical to 
Equations~\ref{eq:CV_E_biosphere_general} and 
\ref{eq:B-CV_E_econ_general}, 
indicating that we have successfully generalized 
the model to any number of sectors.

In this economy, the purpose of the goods and services sector (3) 
is to produce goods and provide services, 
it provides no direct energy to society. 
The purpose of the energy sector (2) is to make direct energy ($\dot{E}$) 
available to the economy and society in a useful form.
We may simplify the above equations
by realizing that (a)~$\dot{E}_{3} = \dot{E}_{3i} = 0$, 
because the goods and services sector 
is assumed to produce no direct energy, 
and (b) $\dot{E}_{03} = 0$, 
because the goods and services sector (3) 
receives no direct energy from the biosphere (0), 
except via the energy sector (2).
Thus, several terms in the sums of
Equation~\ref{eq:C-CV_E_econ_general}
will be zero.

In this section we discuss inflow of direct energy into the automobile industry
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PERKS_energy_auto}.

Total energy use can also be estimated by summing the energy use of the 
underlying detailed processes in manufacturing automobiles. 
Sullivan et al.\ arrive at an estimate of the ``gate-to-gate'' energy
used in the process of creating one automobile (the direct energy used within the
automobile manufacturing process only).\cite{Sullivan2010} 
This estimate can be
mulitplied by the number of vehicles manufactured in a given year 
to obtain total energy use by the 
automobile industry. 
Sullivan estimated a total direct energy use of 34,000 MJ for a generic 1,532 kg vehicle. 
% Using Sullivan's estimate in conjunction with the 19 trillion kJ of total auto industry energy use would suggest that there were
% approximately 560,000 vehicles produced in the US in 2010. (19 million GJ divided by 34 GJ).  That is at least in the ballpark of the estimated 2.7 million actual vehicles produced in 2010.\cite{Motor-Vehicle-Manufacturers-OICA:2014aa}
