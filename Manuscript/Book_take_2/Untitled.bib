Significant progress has been made over the last two decades in improving the performance of amorphous silicon (a-Si) based solar cells and in ramping up the commercial production of a-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules, which is currently more than 40 peak megawatts (MWp) per year. The progress in a-Si solar cell technology can be attributed to concurrent advances in the areas of new and improved materials, novel cell designs and in the development of large-area deposition techniques suitable for mass production. There are currently more than 40 research, development and engineering organisations at universities, companies and government laboratories around the world that are actively investigating a-Si PV technology.},

Although the field is still young, and most activity is in compiling reliable data bases, its systems approach and methods promise to make it a useful tool for evaluating patterns of resource uses.},

abstract = {One technique for evaluating the costs of energy systems is net energy analysis, which compares the quantity of energy delivered to society by an energy system to the energy used directly and indirectly in the delivery process. a quantity called the energy return on investment (EROI). Such an investigation involves aggregating different energy flows. A variety of methods have been proposed, but none has received universal acceptance. This paper shows that the method of aggregation has crucial effects on the results of the analysis. It is argued that economic approaches such as the index or marginal product method are superior because they account for differences in quality among fuels. The thermal equivalent and quality-corrected EROI for petroleum extraction in the US show the same general pattern: a rise to a maximum in the early 1970s, a sharp decline throughout the 1970s. a recovery in the 1980s, and then another modest decline in the 1990s. However, the quality-corrected EROI is consistently much lower than the thermal equivalent EROI, and it declines faster and to a greater extent than the thermal equivalent EROI. The results indicate that quality corrections have important effects on the results of energy analyses. The overall decline in the EROI for petroleum extraction in the US suggests that depletion has raised the energy costs of extraction. This is generally consistent with the overall pattern of oil extraction. i.e. both extraction and the EROI for extraction show a decline since the early 1970s. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Geopressured gas is a vast but diffuse fuel resource in the U.S. Gulf Coast Region. The U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a test drilling program to evaluate the physical parameters of the resource base. Data from this evaluation program and other studies were incorporated into a model that compared the energy costs and yields of extracting geopressured gas. Results indicate that even the most promising geopressured prospects yield little net energy, even under optimistic assumptions concerning labor, government, and environmental energy costs. Conventional natural gas wells still yield substantially greater net fuel. Alternative technologies such as coal gasification also yield greater net fuel. We conclude that geopressured gas resources in the Gulf Coast do not represent a significant source of net energy for the nation based on current knowledge of reservoir parameters and extraction technology.},

abstract = {A series of hypotheses is presented about the relation of national energy use to national economic activity (both time series and cross-sectional) which offer a different perspective from standard economics for the assessment of historical and current economic events. The analysis incorporates nearly 100 years of time series data and 3 years of cross-sectional data on 87 sectors of the United States economy. Gross national product, labor productivity, and price levels are all correlated closely with various aspects of energy use, and these correlations are improved when corrections are made for energy quality. A large portion of the apparent increase in U.S. energy efficiency has been due to our ability to expand the relative use of highquality fuels such as petroleum and electricity, and also to relative shifts in fuel use between sectors of the economy. The concept of energy return on investment is introduced as a major driving force in our economy, and data are provided which show a marked decline in energy return on investment for all our principal fuels in recent decades. Future economic growth will depend largely on the net energy yield of alternative fuel sources, and some standard economic models may need to be modified to account for the biophysical constraints on human economic activity.},

abstract = {Primary energy sources exhibited regular long-term logistic substitution trends from the mid-19th century through the third quarter of the 20th century. This analysis, based on an extension of the Fisher-Pry substitution model, accounted for the observed historical shifts of primary energy use from sources of wood, coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear. In the mid-1980s the substitution dynamics was replaced by a relatively constant contribution from oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, and hydropower. However, a major factor in energy use dynamics in this recent period was substitution of conservation and efficiency for actual fuel use. The energy efficiency is measured as the ratio of economic activity to the rate of energy use (energy intensity). To incorporate these data into the logistic analysis, a method for estimating the fraction of energy saved by the increased efficiency was used. With this interpretation, energy efficiency fits within the substitution model. Furthermore, to identify indications of future energy scenarios, as well as to test the logistic substitution analysis, another statistical approach using ternary diagrams was developed. The consistent results from both logistic substitution and statistical analysis are compared with recent energy projections, trends in decarbonization, Kondratieff waves, and other efficiency measures. While the specific future mix of renewables and nuclear energy sources is uncertain, the more general logistic dynamics pattern of the energy system seems to be continuing as it has for about 150 years now.},

All studies indicated that current corn ethanol technologies are much less petroleum-intensive than gasoline but have greenhouse gas emissions similar to those of gasoline. However, many important environmental effects of biofuel production are poorly understood. New metrics that measure specific resource inputs are developed, but further research into environmental metrics is needed. Nonetheless, it is already clear that large-scale use of ethanol for fuel will almost certainly require cellulosic technology.},

The majority of silicon wafers used for solar cells are Czochralski (CZ) single crystalline and directional solidification, or cast, multicrystalline (mc) material. The split between the two types of wafer is presently about 55\% mc-Si and 45\% CZ-Si. Until 1995 CZ wafers represented 60\% of the substrates used by industry and mc-Si wafers around 25\%. The fast scale up of commercially available multicrystalline wafers changed the picture rapidly. The remainder of the silicon substrates used by the industry are non-wafered sheets or ribbons that are of different types and have recently gained significant production figures, following long development phases. Non-wafer silicon accounted for about 4\% of the market in 2001, up from 1-2\% in the mid-1990s [1, 2].},

Standard theory of economic growth has followed the usual approaches--the mathematico-imaginative and the mechanico-descriptive.

The fact that economic growth involves not only quantitative changes but also qualitative transformations is generally ignored. The understanding of growth calls for a new approach, the analytico-physiological. The inadequacy of standard theory is admirably illustrated by the proof that the Leontief dynamic model, even if considered only as a purely quantitative expansion model, rests on utterly unrealistic assumptions.},

The paper analyzes the problems encountered in applying the concept of energy efficiency in the assesment of human activity. The existence of different hierarchical levels at which energetic efficiency can be assessed (i.e. individual level, societal level, ecological level) can make an objective definition of efficiency difficult if not imp[ossible.
An approach based on the thermodynamics of non-equilibrium is proposed to describe the dynamic interaction between human society and the ecosystem's natural processes. The society is considered a dissipative structure taking energy from the environment and investing energy into the environment in an iterative loop. Adopting this different perspective a more holistic view of the three levels is possible. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Abstract
Since the early days of terrestrial photovoltaics, a common perception has been that `first generation' silicon wafer-based solar cells eventually would be replaced by a `second generation' of lower cost thin-film technology, probably also involving a different semiconductor. Historically, cadmium sulphide, amorphous silicon, copper indium diselenide, cadmium telluride and now thin-film polycrystalline silicon have been regarded as key thin-film candidates. Any mature solar cell technology seems likely to evolve to the stage where costs are dominated by those of the constituent materials, be they silicon wafers or glass sheet. It is argued, therefore, that photovoltaics is likely to evolve, in its most mature form, to a `third generation' of high-efficiency thin-film technology. By high efficiency, what is meant is energy conversion values double or triple the 15--20\% range presently targeted, closer to the thermodynamic limit of 93\%. Tandem cells are the best known of such high-efficiency approaches, where efficiency can be increased merely by adding more cells of different bandgap to a cell stack, at the expense of increased complexity and spectral sensitivity. However, a range of other more `paralleled' approaches offer similar efficiency to an infinite stack of tandem cells. These options are reviewed together with possible approaches for practical implementation, likely to become more feasible with the evolution of materials technology over the next two decades.

An energy breeder can be defined as a device which creates capacity to generate useful energy without consuming energy stocks. Any solar conversion device (SCD) that delivers in its life-time more energy than needed to maintain and rebuild itself is a solar energy breeder, since some of the surplus energy can be used to build more such SCDs. A breeding SCD must necessarily produce energy of sufficiently high intrinsic quality (e.g. electricity) or high temperature to provide energy at the various temperatures needed for its fabrication and maintenance. Thus, the amount of energy produced by an SCD breeder at various temperatures must be examined, in addition to the simple energy quantity produced over a solar collector lifetime. Capacity breeding rates are calculated for both SCDs producing electricity intrinsically (e.g. photovoltaics) and for SCDs producing both electricity and a significant amount of thermal energy (e.g. total solar energy systems).},

abstract = {Studies of popular renewable energy systems show that cumulative energy demand (CED) can be understood as a kind of simplifying life cycle assessment [1] where the accounting of energy and material inputs is seen as part of an inventory analyses and the calculation of CED as a rough form of impact assessment.

Within this research project, three grid-connected photovoltaic systems (sc-Si, pc-Si and a-Si based) are examined in regard to CED and cumulative emissions. The production of these systems was chosen to take place in seven European countries: Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.

Due to the fact that electricity demand does play a major role in production of photovoltaics and that power generation differs throughout these countries CED varies from about 23,200 to 65,200 MJ/kWp. The cumulative emissions (CEm) were found to lie between about 900 and 4000 kg CO2/kWp, 1.9 and 5.5 kg NOx/kWp and 2.4 and 4.8 kg SO2/kWp.},

abstract = {Economic production and, more generally, most global societies, are overwhelmingly dependant upon depleting supplies of fossil fuels. There is considerable concern amongst resource scientists, if not most economists, as to whether market signals or cost benefit analysis based on today\^{a}â¬\{$\backslash$texttrademark\}s prices are sufficient to guide our decisions about our energy future. These suspicions and concerns were escalated during the oil price increase from 2005 \^{a}â¬`` 2008 and the subsequent but probably related market collapse of 2008. We believe that Energy Return On Investment (EROI) analysis provides a useful approach for examining disadvantages and advantages of different fuels and also offers the possibility to look into the future in ways that markets seem unable to do. The goal of this paper is to review the application of EROI theory to both natural and economic realms, and to assess preliminarily the minimum EROI that a society must attain from its energy exploitation to support continued economic activity and social function. In doing so we calculate herein a basic first attempt at the minimum EROI for current society and some of the consequences when that minimum is approached. The theory of the minimum EROI discussed here, which describes the somewhat obvious but nonetheless important idea that for any being or system to survive or grow it must gain substantially more energy than it uses in obtaining that energy, may be especially important. Thus any particular being or system must abide by a \^{a}â¬\oe Law of Minimum EROI\^{a}â¬ , which we calculate for both oil and corn-based ethanol as about 3:1 at the mine-mouth/farm-gate. Since most biofuels have EROI\^{a}â¬\{$\backslash$texttrademark\}s of less than 3:1 they must be subsidized by fossil fuels to be useful.},

Life cycle assessment, a method for the assessment of the environmental impacts of products, is briefly explained. A mathematical method to perform the calculations and to identify dominant aspects in the environmental load of a product is developed. The results are used to derive expressions for a marginal analysis which can be used for improvement analysis. In this way, a designer or process engineer can determine which processes or materials to consider first when (re)designing a product. The method developed can also be used to estimate the reliability of the determination of the environmental load of the products analyzed in terms of the reliability of the data of the processes involved.},

That definition points to an important reason of the occurrence of the problem, but the situation of internal (closed-loop) recycling already indicates that there may be product systems which contain multifunction processes, but which nevertheless need not exhibit an allocation problem. The paper proceeds by examining a number of simple hypothetical cases, and proposes a precise and operational definition of the allocation problem.

The update of LCA results in this paper demonstrates that considerable improvements were reached in the environmental profile of CdTe PV power and EPBT over the last four years. Depending on the location of installation in Europe, the corresponding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of PV power for ground mounted power plants are between 19 and 30 g CO2-equiv./kWh and between 0.7 and 1.1 years in terms of EBPT. Furthermore, for the first time, the environmental impacts due to an already applied recycling procedure of CdTe modules and its relative contribution to the CdTe PV life cycle has been investigated.

For any given energy construction input there is an optimum rate of construction; programmes faster or slower than the optimum will result in less net energy output.},

Most of the technical potential for RE is in intermittently available sources, mainly wind and solar. As penetration from these sources rises, conversion to another energy form, and energy storage, will be needed. Here we assume the energy carrier is hydrogen. This paper examines the consequences for net energy output over time for various rates of growth of wind-hydrogen systems. Wind energy is chosen for this case study because its output is presently far greater than solar, and because its costs are lower. We find that high growth rates of turbine-hydrogen installations lead to [`]boom and bust' cycles in both equipment manufacture, and in net energy output. The main reason for these cycles is that such systems have high up-front input energy costs. To avoid these large swings, the rate of installation will have to be cut back, which limits the rate at which energy alternatives can supplant fossil fuels.},

abstract = {Twenty-seven economists and scientists from ten countries attended this Workshop, which considered the relationships between economic analysis and energy analysis. Energy analysis is a new Held whose objective is the evaluation of resource flows in societal processes using physical units. While we agreed that one of the principal roles of energy analysis is to furnish information that may be utilized in the allocation of the scarce resource energy, the Workshop unanimously concluded that this important function should not be interpreted as implying an energy theory of value. This conclusion rests on the simple observation, applicable across a wide range of institutional forms and degrees of technical development, that bes i des energy resources there are often indispensable primary inputs-labor, land, capital, non-energy minerals -- with equal claim to having their scarcities (relative to the needs for them) expressed in the valuation system that guides allocation. However, many participants believe that the results of energy analyses would have their greatest impact if they were presented in a form suitable for incorporation into a valuation system. Thus, the Workshop stressed the complementarity between economics and energy analysis. rather than elements of competition. The economist and the energy analyst alike believe that energy analysis can provide important physical data for the economic analysis of current productive and consumptive activity. Some Workshop members emphasized the use of energy analysis in assessment of activities in which there is clear evidence of market imperfections or failures. Additionally, energy analysis may be useful in technology assessment and in the evaluation of the impact of macroeconomic policies on energy demand. Technological assessments of this kind can also be used to define constraints within which a viable economic society must exist. It was clear that the interest of some energy analysts is not only in framing a response to scarcity of energy resources, but also in evaluating long-term destructive effects of intensive energy use.},

abstract = {Abstract
The increasing demand for renewable forms of energy is making photovoltaic products an important part of the energy supply future. The costs of producing photovoltaic modules have been significantly reduced during the last 10 years as manufacturing costs per watt have dropped from over 6âper peak watt to less than half of that value now. This paper summarizes progress in several aspects of photovoltaic manufacturing which have contributed to this reduction. Crystal growth improvements, both in yield and machine design, have reduced the energy consumption by a factor of 3 and improved silicon utilization by 40\%. Wafer slicing process changes have resulted in 66\% more wafers being produced for a given amount of silicon. Cell production improvements in both automation and improved efficiency have reduced the labor cost contribution by 40\% per watt. Larger modules and better materials have added another 10\% reduction in the cost to produce photovoltaics. These improvements have contributed to a better energy payback time, reducing it from over 5 years to approximately 3. Reductions in cost and improvements in energy efficiency have made photovoltaic products a commercially viable alternate energy source.

abstract = {In order to forecast the technological development and cost of wind turbines and the production costs of wind electricity, frequent use is made of the so-called experience curve concept. Experience curves of wind turbines are generally based on data describing the development of national markets, which cause a number of problems when applied for global assessments. To analyze global wind energy price development more adequately, we compose a global experience curve. First, underlying factors for past and potential future price reductions of wind turbines are analyzed. Also possible implications and pitfalls when applying the experience curve methodology are assessed. Second, we present and discuss a new approach of establishing a global experience curve and thus a global progress ratio for the investment cost of wind farms. Results show that global progress ratios for wind farms may lie between 77\% and 85\% (with an average of 81\%), which is significantly more optimistic than progress ratios applied in most current scenario studies and integrated assessment models. While the findings are based on a limited amount of data, they may indicate faster price reduction opportunities than so far assumed. With this global experience curve we aim to improve the reliability of describing the speed with which global costs of wind power may decline.},

abstract = {Stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems comprise one of the most promising electrification solutions for covering the demand of remote consumers. However, such systems are strongly questioned due to extreme life-cycle (LC) energy requirements. For similar installations to be considered as environmentally sustainable, their LC energy content must be compensated by the respective useful energy production, i.e. their energy pay-back period (EPBP) should be found less than their service period. In this context, an optimum sizing methodology is currently developed, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy. Various energy autonomous stand-alone PV-lead-acid battery systems are examined and two different cases are investigated; a high solar potential area and a medium solar potential area. By considering that the PV-battery (PV-Bat) system's useful energy production is equal to the remote consumer's electricity consumption, optimum cadmium telluride (CdTe) based systems yield the minimum EPBP (15 years). If achieving to exploit the net PV energy production however, the EPBP is found less than 20 years for all PV types. Finally, the most interesting finding concerns the fact that in all cases examined the contribution of the battery component exceeds 27\% of the system LC energy requirements, reflecting the difference between grid-connected and stand-alone configurations.

abstract = {The exploitation of solar energy by autonomous, photovoltaic (PV) based systems offers the opportunity for satisfying the electrification needs of numerous remote consumers worldwide in an environmentally friendly way. On the other hand, the sustainable character of these systems is strongly questioned by the energy intensity of processes involved in the various life cycle (LC) stages of the system components. Although there are several studies concerned with the estimation of the energy pay-back period (EPBP) for grid-connected systems, the same is not valid for stand-alone configurations. In this context, an integrated methodology is currently developed in order to estimate the EPBP of PV-battery (PV-Bat) configurations ensuring 100\% energy autonomy. The main scope of the proposed analysis is to determine the optimum size of a corresponding system, comprised of multi-crystalline (me-Si) PV modules and lead-acid (PbA) batteries, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy, i.e. minimum EPBP. For this purpose, a representative case study examined considers the electrification needs of a typical remote consumer on the Island of Rhodes, Greece. According to the results obtained, the autonomous energy character of the system is reflected by the comparatively higher EPBP in comparison with the corresponding grid-connected option, nevertheless the PV-Bat configurations analyzed clearly constitute sustainable energy solutions. Finally, in order to increase the reliability of the calculation results, a sensitivity analysis is carried out, based on the variation of the input energy content data.

abstract = {In life cycle assessment (LCA) of solar PV systems, energy pay back time (EPBT) is the commonly used indicator to justify its primary energy use. However, EPBT is a function of competing energy sources with which electricity from solar PV is compared, and amount of electricity generated from the solar PV system which varies with local irradiation and ambient conditions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use site-specific EPBT for major decision-making in power generation planning. LCA and life cycle cost analysis are performed for a distributed 2.7 kW(p) grid-connected monocrystalline solar PV system operating in Singapore. This paper presents various EPBT analyses of the solar PV system with reference to a fuel oil-fired steam turbine and their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs are also compared. The study reveals that GHG emission from electricity generation from the solar PV system is less than one-fourth that from an oil-fired steam turbine plant and one-half that from a gas-fired combined cycle plant. However, the cost of electricity is about five to seven times higher than that from the oil or gas fired power plant. The environmental uncertainties of the solar PV system are also critically reviewed and presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All other characteristics being equal, a fuel or energy system with a higher EROI or EIR is of better quality because more energy is provided to society. I define and calculate the EIR for oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity as measures of the energy intensity (units of energy divided by money) of the energy resource relative to the energy intensity of the overall economy. EIR measures based upon various unit prices for energy(e.g. /Btu of a barrel of oil) as well as total expenditures on energy supplies (e.g. total dollars spent on petroleum) indicate net energy at different points in the supply chain of the overall energy system. The results indicate that EIR is an easily calculated and effective proxy for EROI for US oil, gas, coal, and electricity. The EIR correlates well with previous EROI calculations, but adds additional information on energy resource quality within the supply chain. Furthermore, the EIR and EROI of oil and gas as well as coal were all in decline for two time periods within the last 40 years, and both time periods preceded economic recessions.},

Crystalline silicon modules achieve an energy break-even in 3 to 4 years.

abstract = {- Part 1: Present Situation and Future Perspectives Part 2: Application on an Island Economy Goal, Scope and Background Incorporation of exposure and risk concepts into life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is often impaired by the number of sources and the complexity of site-specific impact assessment, especially when input-output (I-O) analysis is used to evaluate upstream processes. This makes it difficult to interpret LCIA outputs, especially in policy contexts. In this study, we develop an LCIA tool which takes into account the geographical variability in both emissions and exposure, and which can be applied to all economic sectors in I-O analysis. Our method relies on screening-level risk calculations and methods to estimate population exposure per unit of emissions from specific geographic locations. Methods We propose a simplified impact assessment approach using the concept of intake fraction, which is the fraction of a pollutant or its precursor emitted that is eventually inhaled or ingested by the population. Instead of running a complex site-specific exposure analysis, intake fractions allow for the accounting of the regional variability in exposure due to meteorological factors and population density without much computational burden. We calculate sector-specific intake fractions using previously-derived regression models and apply these values to the supply chain emissions to screen for the sectors whose emissions largely contribute to the total exposures. Thus, the analytical steps are simplified by relying on these screening-level risk calculations. We estimate population exposure per unit emissions from specific geographic locations only for the facilities and pollutants that pass an initial screening analysis. We test our analytical approach with reference to the case of increasing insulation for new single-family homes in the US. We quantify the public health costs from increasing insulation manufacturing and compare them with the benefits from energy savings, focusing on mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to primary and secondary fine particles (PM2.5) as well as cancer risk associated with exposure to toxic air pollutants. We estimate health impacts using concentration-response functions from the published literature and compare the costs and benefits of the program by assigning monetary values to the health risks. In the second part of this paper, we present the results of our case study and consider the implications for incorporating exposure and risk concepts into I-O LCA. Conclusions We have presented a methodology to incorporate regional variability in emissions and exposure into input-output LCA, using reduced-form information about the relationship between emissions and population exposure, along with standard input-output analysis and risk assessment methods. The location-weighted intake fractions can overcome the difficulty in incorporation of regional exposure in LCIA.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic installations (PV-systems) are heavily promoted in Europe. In this paper, the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) method is used to find out whether the high subsidy cost can be justified by the environmental benefits. Most existing LCAs of PV only use one-dimensional indicators and are only valid for regions with a high solar irradiation. This paper, however, presents a broad environmental evaluation of residential PV-systems for regions with a rather low solar irradiation of 900-1000 kWh/m2/year, a value typical for Northern Europe and Canada. Based on the Ecoinvent LCA database, six Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods were considered for six different PV-technologies; the comprehensive Eco-Indicator 99 (EI 99) with its three perspectives (Hierarchist, Egalitarian and Individualistic) next to three one-dimensional indicators, namely Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Energy Payback Time (EPT). For regions with low solar irradiation, we found that the EPT is less than 5 years. The Global Warming Potential of PV-electricity is about 10 times lower than that of electricity from a coal fired plant, but 4 times higher when compared to a nuclear power plant or a wind farm. Surprisingly, our results from the more comprehensive EI 99 assessment method do not correlate at all with our findings based on EPT and GWP. The results from the Individualist perspective are strongly influenced by the weighting of the different environmental aspects, which can be misleading. Therefore, to obtain a well-balanced environmental assessment of energy technologies, we recommend a carefully evaluated combination of various impact assessment methods.},

abstract = {
Concern over the increasing concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere is causing us to re-evaluate how we use energy. In particular, we need to inquire if there are alternative energy systems which discharge less net CO2 per unit of energy service. This paper deals with the CO2 fluxes associated with the use of one biomass fuel, ethanol derived from corn. In a sustainable agricultural system, there is no net CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the corn itself but there is a net CO2 flux due to the fossil-fuel supplements currently used to produce and process corn. A comparison between ethanol from corn and gasoline from crude oil becomes very complex because of the variability of corn yield, the lack of available data on corn processing, and the complexity of treating the multiple products from corn processing. When the comparison is made on an energy content basis only, with no consideration of how the products are to be used, and at the margin of the current U.S. energy system, it appears that there is a net CO2 saving associated with ethanol from corn. This net saving in CO2 emissions may be as large as 40\% or as small as 20\%, depending on how one chooses to evaluate the by-product credits. This analysis also demonstrates that the frequently posed question, whether the energy inputs to ethanol exceed the energy outputs, would not be an over-riding consideration even if it were true, because most of the inputs are as coal and natural gas, whereas the output is as a high-quality liquid fuel.},

A method of extending such analysis to cover dynamic implications of energy input and output has been established and demonstrated through this work. The methodology establishes a dynamic balance between energy input as cumulative energy demand for building new systems and output from available power plants that puts a limit on rate of building new plants. Separate analysis of different technologies in Indian context reveals that this maximum growth rate can be as low as 7.24\% for mono-crystalline photovoltaic systems and as high as 216.7\% for small wind energy systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an environmental comparison based on life cycle assessment (LCA) of the production under average European circumstances and use in The Netherlands of modules based on two kinds of III-V solar cells in an early development stage: a thin-film gallium arsenide (GaAs) cell and a thin-film gallium-indium phosphide/gallium arsenide (GaInP/GaAs) tandem cell. A more general comparison of these modules with the common multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) module is also included. The evaluation of the both III-V systems is made for a limited industrial production scale of 01MWp per year, compared to a scale of about 10MWp per year for the multi-Si system. The here considered III-V cells allow for reuse of the GaAs wafers that are required for their production.The LCA indicates that the overall environmental impact of the production of the III-V modules is larger than the impact of the common multi-Si module production; per category their scores have the same order of magnitude. For the III-V systems the metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) process is the main contributor to the primary energy consumption. The energy payback times of the thin-film GaAs and GaInP/GaAs modules are 50 and 46 years, respectively. For the multi-Si module an energy payback time of 42 years is found. The results for the III-V modules have an uncertainty up to approximately 40\%. The highly comparable results for the III-V systems and the multi-Si system indicate that from an environmental point of view there is a case for further development of both III-V systems.

In this paper, the authors discuss the results of a Cost of Ownership (CoO) evaluation of a proprietary SGS manufacturing process, assigned by MB Scientific to One Solar Energy (OSE Process), a new venture in SGS manufacturing. The OSE Process, from quartz to SGS, is based on a new single-electrode arc furnace, used to produce high quality MGSi, coupled to a refining system to reduce B and P down to the required SGS levels. In particular, the authors compare the specific energy consumption (SEC) and CO2 emissions (COE) for various technologies used in manufacturing this Upgraded Metallurgical Silicon (UMG) SGS. The SEC differences between our SGS process and the current state-of-the-art, ultra high purity polysilicon process, are due to improved thermal efficiency and Si recovery of our arc furnace over conventional 3phase submerged arc silicon furnaces. The overall low cost and cleanliness of our ``green'' process is due to the superior SEC, high recovery of silicon, low emissions, and recycling of CO gas for power generation.},

The last three years have seen an unprecedented growth of interest in solar cells made from organic electronic materials. This is due partly to the rapid growth of the photovoltaic market, which has stimulated research into longer term, more innovative photovoltaic technologies, and partly to the development of organic electronic materials for display applications. Rapid progress in optoelectronic molecular materials has introduced a range of potential new photovoltaic materials, as well as an improved understanding of the capabilities of such materials and confidence in their application.

abstract = {The extent and timing of cost-reducing improvements in low-carbon energy systems are important sources of uncertainty in future levels of greenhouse-gas emissions. Models that assess the costs of climate change mitigation policy, and energy policy in general, rely heavily on learning curves to include technology dynamics. Historically, no energy technology has changed more dramatically than photovoltaics (PV), the cost of which has declined by a factor of nearly 100 since the 1950s. Which changes were most important in accounting for the cost reductions that have occurred over the past three decades? Are these results consistent with the notion that learning from experience drove technical change? In this paper, empirical data are assembled to populate a simple model identifying the most important factors affecting the cost of PV. The results indicate that learning from experience, the theoretical mechanism used to explain learning curves, only weakly explains change in the most important factors---plant size, module efficiency, and the cost of silicon. Ways in which the consideration of a broader set of influences, such as technical barriers, industry structure, and characteristics of demand, might be used to inform energy technology policy are discussed.},

abstract = {In this study, the environmental load of photovoltaic power generation system (PV) during its life cycle and energy payback time (EPT) are evaluated by LCA scheme. Two hypothetical case studies in Toyohashi, Japan and Gobi dessert in China have been carried out to investigate the influence of installation location and PV type on environmental load and EPT. The environmental load and EPT of a high-concentration photovoltaic power generation system (hcpV) and a multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic power generation system (mc-Si PV) are studied. The study shows for a PV of 100 MW size, the total impacts of the hcpV installed in Toyohashi is larger than that of the hcpV installed in Gobi desert by 5\% without consideration of recycling stage. The EPT of the hcpV assumed to be installed in Gobi desert is shorter than EPT of the hcpV assumed to be installed in Toyohashi by 0.64 year. From these results, the superiority to install PV in Gobi desert is certificated. Comparing with hcpV and mc-Si PV, the ratio of the total impacts of mc-Si PV to that of hcpV is 0.34 without consideration of recycling stage. The EPT of hcpV is longer than EPT of mc-Si PV by 0.27 year. The amount of global solar radiation contributing to the amount of power generation of mc-Si PV is larger than the amount of direct solar radiation contributing to the amount of power generation of hcpV by about 188 kW h/(m(2) year) in Gobi desert. Consequently, it appears that using mc-Si PV in Gobi desert is the best option. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper assesses modeling parameters that affect the environmental performance of two state-of-the-art photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation technologies: the PVL136 thin film laminates and the KC120 multi-crystalline modules. We selected three metrics to assess the modules' environmental performance, which are part of an actual 33 kW installation in Ann Arbor, MI. The net energy ratio (NER), the energy pay back time (E-PBT), and the CO2 emissions are calculated using process based LCA methods. The results reveal some of the parameters, such as the level of solar radiation, the position of the modules, the modules' manufacturing energy intensity and its corresponding fuel mix, and the solar radiation conversion efficiency of the modules, which affect the final analytical results. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of selected parameters on the final results. For the baseline scenario, the E-PBT for the PVL136 and KC120 are 3.2 and 7.5 years, respectively. When expected future conversion efficiencies are tested, the E-PBT is 1.6 and 5.7 years for the PVL136 and the KC120, respectively. Based on the US fuel mix, the CO2 emissions for the PVL136 and the KC120 are 34.3 and 72.4 g of CO2/kW h, respectively. The most effective way to improve the modules' environmental performance is to reduce the energy input in the manufacturing phase of the modules, provided that other parameters remain constant. Consequently, the use of PV as an electricity source during PV manufacturing is also assessed. The NER of the supplier PV is key for the performance of this scheme. The results show that the NER based on a PV system can be 3.7 times higher than the NER based on electricity supplied by the traditional grid mix, and the CO2 emissions can be reduced by 80\%.},

It is well known that silicon in its various structural configurations (single crystal, multicrystalline, amorphous, micro-nanocrystalline) supplies almost 90\% of the substrates used in the photovoltaic industry. It is also known, since years, that the photovoltaic (PV) industry shows a marked growth trend, which demanded and demands a continuous, huge increase of the bulk silicon supply in the order of 30\%/yr.
In order to fulfill their today- and future needs, many companies worldwide took the decision to start the installation of many thousand tons/year plants, most of them using the Siemens process, some of them using the MG route, to produce the so called solar grade (SG) silicon.
The advantages of the Siemens process are well known, as it provides ultrapure silicon, directly usable for growing either single crystalline Czochralski ingots or multicrystalline ingots using the directional solidification (DS) technique.
The disadvantages are its high energetic cost (a minimum of 120ï¿½kWH/kg) and the possible losses of chlorinated gases in the atmosphere, with possible severe environmental problems.
The advantages of the MG route are still potential, as there is no commercially available production of solar silicon as yet, and rely on its reduced energetic costs (a maximum of 25-30ï¿½kWh/kg) for a feedstock directly usable for growing multicrystalline ingots using the DS technique. The drawbacks of silicon of MG origin are its larger concentration of metallic impurities, as compared with the Siemens one, the higher B and P content, and the potentially high carbon content.
The aim of this paper is to deal with some of the problems encountered so far with the silicon of MG origin with respect to the metallic and non-metallic impurities content, as well as to propose technologically feasible solar grade feedstock specifications.},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the results of a thorough energy and life cycle assessment (LIA) of CdTe and CIS photovoltaic modules. The analysis is based on actual production data, making it one of the very first of its kind to be presented to the scientific community, and therefore especially worthy of attention as a preliminary indication of the future environmental impact that the up-scaling of thin film module production may entail. The analysis is consistent with the recommendations provided by ISO norms 14040 and updates, and makes use of an in-house developed multi-method impact assessment method named SUMMA, which includes resource demand indicators, energy efficiency indicators, and ``downstream'' environmental impact indicators. A comparative framework is also provided, wherein electricity produced by thin film systems such as the ones under study is set up against electricity from poly-Si systems and the average European electricity mix. Results clearly show an overall very promising picture for thin film technologies, which are found to be characterised by favourable environmental impact indicators (with special reference to CdTe systems), in spite of their still comparatively lower efficiencies.},

abstract = {The use of polymer materials for photovoltaic applications is expected to have several advantages over current crystalline silicon technology. In this paper, we perform an environmental and economic assessment of polymer-based thin film modules with a glass substrate and modules with a flexible substrate and we compare our results with literature data for multicrystalline (mc-) silicon photovoltaics and other types of PV. The functional unit of this study is `25 years of electricity production by PV systems with a power of 1 watt-peak (Wp)'. Because the lifetime of polymer photovoltaics is at present much lower than of mc-silicon photovoltaics, we first compared the PV cells per watt-peak and next determined the minimum required lifetime of polymer PV to arrive at the same environmental impacts as mc-silicon PV. We found that per watt-peak of output power, the environmental impacts compared to mc-silicon are 20--60\% lower for polymer PV systems with glass substrate and 80--95\% lower for polymer PV with PET as substrate (flexible modules). Also in comparison with thin film CuInSe and thin film silicon, the impacts of polymer modules, per watt-peak, appeared to be lower. The costs per watt-peak of polymer PV modules with glass substrate are approximately 20\% higher compared to mc-silicon photovoltaics. However, taking into account uncertainties, this might be an overestimation. For flexible modules, no cost data were available. If the efficiency and lifetime of polymer PV modules increases, both glass-based and flexible polymer PV could become an environment friendly and cheap alternative to mc-silicon PV.

The paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the electric generation by means of photovoltaic panels. It considers mass and energy flows over the whole production process starting from silica extraction to the final panel assembling, considering the most advanced and consolidate technologies for polycrystalline silicon panel production. Some considerations about the production cycle are reported; the most critical phases are the transformation of metallic silicon into solar silicon and the panel assembling. The former process is characterised by a great electricity consumption, even if the most efficient conversion technology is considered, the latter by the use of aluminium frame and glass roofing, which are very energy-intensive materials. Moreover, the energy pay back time (EPBT) and the potential for CO2 mitigation have been evaluated, considering different geographic collocations of the photovoltaic plant with different values of solar radiation, latitude, altitude and national energetic mix for electricity production.},

Most prior net-energy studies of nuclear-power systems accounted only for the direct consumption of fuels and the indirect consumption of energy embodied in physical materials when making such estimates. Most ignored the energy embodied in labor, government, and financial services. In this study, total economic cost is used as a surrogate to estimate the total input-energy cost of constructing, operating, financing, and disposal of nuclear-power systems. Although the cost and performance data used in this study are from light-water reactor systems experience, it is assumed that fast-neutron reactors may be substituted for light-water reactors when economic conditions dictate. We make the conservative assumption that the cost and performance characteristics of fast-neutron reactors will be similar to those of light-water reactors. We conclude that the operation of a large nuclear-power system, involving a continuing construction program of starting one new 1000-MW system each month for 100 yrs, would yield a relatively small amount of net energy, under optimistic assumptions. Under less-optimistic assumptions the net-energy yield is negligible to negative. The average net-energy yield increases, somewhat, when optimistic assumptions are added to account for the possibility of improved efficiency in an all-electric economy.},

A multi-method multi-scale assessment procedure is applied in order to generate consistent performance indicators based on the same set of input data, to ascertain the existence of constraints or crucial steps characterized by low conversion efficiency and to provide the basis for improvement patterns. Optimizing the performance of a given process requires that many different aspects are taken into account. Some of them, mostly of technical nature, relate to the local scale at which the process occurs. Other technological, economic and environmental aspects are likely to affect the dynamics of the larger space and time scales in which the process is embedded. These spatial and time scale effects require that a careful evaluation of the relation between the process and its surroundings is performed, so that hidden consequences and possible sources of inefficiency and impact are clearly identified. In this paper we analyse and compare selected electricity conversion systems, alternative fuels and biofuels, waste management strategies and finally the time evolution of an urban system, in order to show the importance of a multiple perspective point of view for the proper evaluation of a system's environmental and resource use performance.},

With raw materials for crystalline solar cells in increasingly short supply, renewed efforts are being made in the study of ways to make practical thin-film solar cells for use in tomorrow's large-scale solar cell installations. In particular, since thin-film polycrystalline silicon solar cells are made of the same materials as frequently used, bulk silicon solar cells, they are being enthusiastically studied at laboratories worldwide due to the abundance of raw materials for such devices, their stability, and the characteristics they are expected to possess as silicon devices. Part of the motivation behind these studies comes from the theoretical finding that if these devices can be constructed so that they trap sufficient light, it should ideally be possible to achieve photoelectric conversion efficiencies in excess of 20\%, even with solar cells in which the photoelectric layer is just a few micrometres thick [1].},
