\section{Model economy}
%%%%%%%%%%

The model economy employed herein consists of sectors that produce a single product, either an energy product (energy sectors) or other goods and services (non-energy sectors). Economic sectors receive as inputs direct energy ($E$) and materials in which energy is embodied ($B$).\footnote{A formal definition for embodied energy ($B$) is presented in Section \ref{sec:embodied_energy}.} Economic sectors emit waste heat ($Q$).

%%%%%%%%%% Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Direct energy ($E$), indirect (embodied) energy ($B$), and waste heat ($Q$)}
%%%%%%%%%%

We distinguish between direct energy resources ($E$), such as coal or oil, and indirect energy ($B$) ``embodied'' in outputs from economic sectors. $E$ represents the energetic value of an energy resource (measured as heating value, chemical potential energy, or exergy). In contrast, $B$ represents the energy expended in the production and delivery of goods in the economy, and, as such, measures accumulated upstream energy consumption from the network of economic sectors within the economy. `Indirect' energy and `embodied' energy are synonyms. Both $E$ and $B$ are measured in energy units (joules or BTUs). The flow rates of direct energy ($\dot{E}$) and indirect energy ($\dot{B}$) among sectors of the economy, the Earth, and society are in units of power (energy per unit time, J/time or BTU/time).

Waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) flows from sectors of the economy and society to the Earth and its atmosphere, the necessary result of inefficient consumption of direct energy $E$. Like $\dot{E}$ and $\dot{B}$, the units of $\dot{Q}$ are energy per unit time.

%%%%%%%%%% Methodology %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Total energy ($T$)}
%%%%%%%%%%

Total energy ($T$) is the sum of the direct and indirect (embodied) energy.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_def}
	T \equiv E + B
\end{equation}

In general, the flow rate of total energy among sectors in the economy, the earth, and society is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_dot_def}
	\dot{T} = \dot{E} + \dot{B}.
\end{equation}

In some cases, total energy flows may consist of direct energy ($\dot{E}$) or embodied energy ($\dot{B}$) exclusively. For example, the flow of extracted crude oil from the earth consists of direct energy only ($\dot{B} = 0$ and $\dot{T} = \dot{E}$), because, in this method, no embodied energy ($B$) has been added to the crude oil until it reaches the downstream side of the pump. The flow of goods produced by a non-energy sector of the economy consists of indirect energy only ($\dot{E} = 0$, and therefore $\dot{T} = \dot{B}$), because no direct energy ($E$) is produced by a non-energy sector in this model economy. 

In other cases, total energy flows may have both direct \emph{and} indirect components. For example, the flow of refined petroleum from the energy sector has both a direct energy ($\dot{E}$, the energy content of the oil product, usually represented by chemical potential energy) and embodied energy ($\dot{B}$, which accounts for the energy consumed in upstream processes to extract and refine the crude oil).\footnote{Outputs from agricultural sectors will be similar: both the direct energy component (comprising chemical potential energy) and the embodied energy component will be non-zero.}

Single subscripts on $T$, $E$, or $B$ can mean one of two things: $\dot{T}_{i}$ indicates the outflow of total energy from sector $i$, whereas $T_{i}$ denotes the total energy content of sector $i$. Double subscripts on $T$, $E$, or $B$ (e.g., $\dot{T}_{ij}$) indicate a flow from sector $i$ to sector $j$,\footnote{In the following discussion, the first index always indicates the sector \emph{from} which a quantity flows, and the second index indicates the sector \emph{to} which a quantity flows.} in this case for total energy ($T$).  

The I-O literature \cite{Bullard1975, Herendeen1978} [REF TO BULLARD AND HERENDEEN, ETC. HERE --MKH] assumes (a) that steady state conditions exist (i.e., no accumulation of total energy in economic sectors) and (b) that flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) are \emph{conserved}, where by \emph{conserved}, it is meant that total energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Like the literature, we assume that total energy is conserved. However, we depart from the literature to allow durability of goods as represented by total energy accumulation in economic sectors. Steady state, this approach is not.

Total energy may accumulate within an economic sector as stocks of direct energy materials (piles of coal or tanks of oil) but also as embodied energy in stocks of capital goods (e.g. machinery or buildings). The rate of accumulation of total energy ($\frac{dT}{dt}$) in a sector of the economy, the Earth, or society is given by the time derivative of total energy:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:T_accum_def}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}B}{\mathrm{d}t}.
\end{equation}

We note that the definition of total energy (Equation \ref{eq:T_def}) includes direct energy ($E$) and embodied energy ($B$) terms. On the other hand, the First Law of Thermodynamics includes direct energy ($E$) and waste heat ($Q$) terms. The consequence of the foregoing difference is that an interesting relationship exists between embodied energy ($B$) and waste heat ($Q$). We shall see in the following example that waste heat from an economic sector can be considered to contribute to energy embodied within the products of that sector.
