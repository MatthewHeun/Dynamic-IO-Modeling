In this section, we present an example economic analysis using a single-sector economy wherein the economy and society are merged together.

Figure \ref{fig:single_sector_flows_0} shows a single-sector Economy (represented by ``economy/society,'' 2) that extracts direct energy from the earth ($\dot{E}_{12}$). Direct energy and waste heat flows are identified by vectors. No direct energy flows from the economy (2) to the earth (1), only waste heat ($\dot{Q}_{21}$).

\label{fig:single_sector_flows_0}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%% Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{First Law of Thermodynamics}
%%%%%%%%%%

Both direct energy ($\dot{E}$, such as the energy content of coal, oil, and electricity), and waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) are accounted by the First Law of Thermodynamics. Accounting for possible accumulation of direct energy in the economy, the First Law of Thermodynamics indicates that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dE_2/dt_single_sector}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{E}_{12} - \dot{Q}_{21}.
\end{equation}

Aside from, for example, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we are not stockpiling oil and coal at any meaningful rate, i.e. we consume fossil fuels at a rate equal to the extraction rate. Thus, the world is not accumulating direct energy in the economy.\footnote{A counter-example could be made for nuclear fuels where `spent' fuel represents a large exergetic stockpile, however, this reserve is not (presently) economically useful.} (The world \emph{is}, however, accumulating embodied energy in the economy as we shall see shortly.) Thus, the accumulation rate for direct energy $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)$ in the above equation can be set to zero to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_direct_energy_no_accumulation}
	0 = \dot{E}_{12} - \dot{Q}_{21}.
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%% Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Total energy accounting}
%%%%%%%%%%

Figure \ref{fig:single_sector_flows_2} shows the flows of total energy ($\dot{T}$) through the single-sector economy.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Chapter_Example_A/images/I-O_one_sector_total_energy.pdf}
\caption{Total Energy Flows ($\dot{T}$) in a Single-sector Economy.}
\label{fig:single_sector_flows_2}
\end{figure}

We follow the I-O literature in assuming that total energy ($T$) is conserved. The I-O literature assumes steady-state operation of the economy with no accumulation of embodied energy in the economic sectors. (We will see later how the assumption in the literature introduces errors into I-O analyses.) We depart from the I-O literature by accounting for both accumulation and depreciation of energy embodied in sectors of the economy and society. By doing so, the present analysis does \emph{not} assume a steady-state economy. A total energy accounting around the single-sector economy (2) gives

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_T_with_accumulation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}T_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{T}_{12}  - \dot{T}_{21}.
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%% Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Embodied energy accounting}
%%%%%%%%%%

The First Law of Thermodynamics accounts for both direct energy ($E$) and waste heat ($Q$), whereas total energy ($T$) accounting tracks direct energy ($E$) and embodied energy ($B$). If we substitute the First Law into the total energy accounting equation, we can eliminate direct energy ($E$) to arrive at an embodied energy accounting equation. We begin by expanding the $T$ terms in Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_T_with_accumulation} using Equations \ref{eq:T_def} and \ref{eq:T_dot_def} to obtain

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_T_with_accumulation_expanded_T}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{E}_{12} + \dot{B}_{12} - \dot{E}_{21} - \dot{B}_{21}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Realizing that $\frac{\mathrm{d}E_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$ (because direct energy does not accumulate in meaningful amounts in the economy) and $\dot{E}_{21} = 0$ (because energy is returned to the earth as waste heat, see Figure \ref{fig:single_sector_flows_0}) yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_B_accumulation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{E}_{12} + \dot{B}_{12} - \dot{B}_{21}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_B_accumulation} shows that the accumulation rate of embodied energy in the economy is a function of the inflows of direct and embodied energy less the outflow of embodied energy. 

In this example, we substitute\footnote{We shall encounter this move to substitute the First Law of Thermodynamics into the total energy accounting equation repeatedly below.} Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_direct_energy_no_accumulation} into Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_B_accumulation} to obtain an embodied energy accounting equation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:embodied_energy_accounting}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{Q}_{21} + \dot{B}_{12} - \dot{B}_{21}.
\end{equation}

An important result of Bullard-Herendeen-style I-O analyses, historically, has been the quantification of the embodied energy content of economic sector outputs, in this case $\dot{B}_{21}$. Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_B_accumulation} can be rearranged to give

\begin{equation} \label{eq:single_sector_B_output}
	\dot{B}_{21} = \dot{Q}_{21} + \dot{B}_{12} - \frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}.
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_B_output} indicates that the embodied energy content of the product of an economic sector (in this case $\dot{B}_{21}$) can be thought of as the sum of the embodied energy inputs to the sector (in this case $\dot{B}_{12}$) and the waste heat from the sector (in this case $\dot{Q}_{21}$) less the accumulation rate of embodied energy in the sector (in this case $\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}$). This derivation indicates that waste heat ($\dot{Q}$) plays an important role\footnote{To our knowledge, there has been no prior identification of the role of waste heat in Bullard-Herendeen-style I-O analyses.} in Bullard-Herendeen-style I-O analyses: the accumulation of waste heat along a production path leads to energy being `embodied' in the output of an economic sector. 

In Equation \ref{eq:single_sector_B_output} we also see the first indication that the traditional approach of neglecting dynamic effects in I-O analyses may lead to errors. If $\frac{\mathrm{d}B_2}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is both neglected and nonzero, calculation of the embodied energy outflow rate ($\dot{B}_{21}$) will be in error.

%%%%%%%%%% Example A %%%%%%%%%%
\section{Depreciation}
%%%%%%%%%%

It is worthwhile to note that $\dot{B}_{21}$ represents the disposal rate of embodied energy from the economy back to the earth, akin to depreciation of physical assets. This physical depreciation is different from, but related to, financial depreciation, as financial depreciation is usually faster than physical depreciation. Embodied energy depreciation ($\dot{B}_{21}$ in this example) can be represented by a depreciation term such as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:depreciation_term_defined}
	\dot{B}_{21} = \gamma_{2}B_{2},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\gamma$ represents the depreciation rate in units of inverse time (e.g., 1/year) with $\gamma > 0$. The depreciation rate ($\gamma$) indicates that a fraction of the total stock of embodied energy is disposed over a period of time (e.g, $\gamma = 0.05$/year). In the absence of other inputs or outputs, this depreciation function provides exponential decay of embodied energy ($B$). $\gamma$ is, in general, a function of time.

Equation \ref{eq:depreciation_term_defined} can be substituted into Equation \ref{eq:embodied_energy_accounting} and rearranged to obtain 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dB2/dt_single_sector_with_depreciation_gamma}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t} =  \dot{Q}_{21} + \dot{B}_{12} - \gamma_{2}B_{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent which indicates that the accumulation rate of embodied energy in an economic sector (in this case $\frac{\mathrm{d}B_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t}$) is equal to the sum of the waste heat rate from the economic sector ($\dot{Q}_{21}$) and the inflow rate of embodied energy to the sector ($\dot{B}_{12}$) less the embodied energy disposal rate ($\gamma_{2}B_{2}$).
